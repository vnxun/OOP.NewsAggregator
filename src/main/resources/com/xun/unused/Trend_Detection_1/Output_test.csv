https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/25/business/shoptalk-fud-fear-uncertainty-doubt.html,08/25/23,Tuesday was the 35th anniversary of the day that Tim Berners-Lee of the European Organization for Nuclear Research wrote the memo proposing what became the World Wide Web. Queen Elizabeth II knighted him in 2004 for his achievement. I think it is fair to say though that most people are not in the mood to celebrate what has become of Sir Timothys invention. It is common to hear that the internet is broken and that social media is a dumpster fire. Recent case in point: On Wednesday the House voted to force the Chinese owners of TikTok to sell it or be banned from the United States on the grounds that it has become a channel for what the House majority leader called Chinese data collection and propaganda.Technology types are working on cures for what ails the internet and their cures are no surprise technological. I have been reading up on some of them. A lot go in the right direction but I have not seen anything that seems likely to fully solve the many problems of today's internet from invasions of privacy to incitements of violence. That is a tall order. Fortunately a lot of smart people are taking the issues seriously. Lasting solutions if there are any are likely to come from a combination of technological legal and cultural approaches. Back to the nerds: On Tuesday Berners-Lee published an open letter on Medium that said the web was intended to be a tool to empower humanityÂ that was decentralized with a long tail of content and options.Â In the past decade though he wrote instead of embodying these values the web has instead played a part in eroding them. Berners-Lee is developing and proselytizing for a new system that gives each person his or her own personal online-only data store or POD for short. The PODs let people decide how their data is managed used and shared. The Flanders region of Belgium has already authorized PODs for all of its citizens Berners-Lee wrote.

https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2022/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-a-blockchain,08/06/22,Cryptocurrencies have gone from a curiosity to a sizable force in finance technology and culture making them almost impossible to ignore. A range of players have embraced crypto from individual speculators to major financial institutions despite how volatile they are.. Some have generated vast riches while others have destroyed huge amounts of wealth. When people talk about crypto they may be referring to one of many different ideas and companies. The industry is booming and spawning an abundance of projects and new terms to go with them. The topic can be confusing but the concept has also become ubiquitous. Learning the right terminology can help. Jump to: What is a Bitcoin? What is Bitcoin mining? What is a blockchain? What is Coinbase? What are cryptocurrencies? What is DeFi? What is an NFT? What is a stablecoin? What is web3? What is a Bitcoin? A Bitcoin is a digital token that can be sent electronically from one user to another anywhere in the world. A Bitcoin can be divided out to eight decimal places so you can send someone 0.00000001 Bitcoin. This smallest fraction of a Bitcoin — the penny of the Bitcoin world — is referred to as a Satoshi named after the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is also the name of the payment network on which this form of digital currency is stored and moved. Unlike traditional payment networks such as Visa the Bitcoin network is not run by a single company or person. The system is run by a decentralized network of computers around the world that keep track of all Bitcoin transactions similar to the way Wikipedia is maintained by a decentralized network of writers and editors. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a creator who goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto who communicated with the rest of the world only by email and social messaging. While several people have been identified as possibly being Satoshi the identity of the real Satoshi has not been confirmed. Satoshi created the original rules of the Bitcoin network and then shared the software with the rest of the world in 2009. The inventor largely disappeared from the public two years later. Once Satoshi had released the software anyone could download and use it. This means Satoshi has no more control over the network now than anyone else. What is Bitcoin mining? Bitcoin mining refers to the process through which new Bitcoins are created and given to computers helping to maintain the network. The computers involved in Bitcoin mining are in a sort of computational race to process new transactions coming onto the network solving complex math problems that require quintillions of numerical guesses per second. The winner of that race — generally the person with the fastest computers — gets a chunk of new Bitcoins. Since miners can earn rewards but are independent this process is meant to incentivize participation and maintenance. There is generally a new winner about every 10 minutes and this will continue until there are 21 million Bitcoins in the world. At that point no new Bitcoins will be created. The network is expected to reach that cap in 2140. Every Bitcoin in existence was created through this method and initially given to a computer helping to maintain the records. In Bitcoin's early years a crypto enthusiast could mine coins by running software on a laptop. But as the digital assets have become more popular the amount of power necessary to win the race and generate Bitcoins has soared. A single Bitcoin transaction now requires more than 2000 kilowatt-hours of electricity or enough energy to sustain the average U.S. household for 73 days according to some estimates. ADVERTISEMENT  What is a blockchain? A blockchain is a database that is maintained communally and that reliably stores digital information. The original blockchain was the database on which all Bitcoin transactions were stored. It was named “blockchain” because the transactions coming onto the network were grouped into blocks of data and then chained together using sophisticated math. After the Bitcoin blockchain had operated for a number of years successfully storing every Bitcoin transaction and surviving numerous attacks from hackers many programmers and entrepreneurs wondered if its design could be replicated to create other kinds of secure ledgers unrelated to Bitcoin. Companies and governments that don't rely on currency have since begun using blockchain technology to store their data. Banks are building blockchains that can track payments between accounts while governments are experimenting with using blockchains to store property records and votes. What is Coinbase? Coinbase is a platform that allows people and companies to buy and sell various digital currencies including Bitcoin for a transaction fee. It is similar to a stock exchange. Founded in San Francisco in 2012 Coinbase allows people and companies to buy and sell various digital currencies including Bitcoin. In April 2021 Coinbase became the first major cryptocurrency company to list its shares on a U.S. stock exchange. Coinbase set itself apart from other early blockchain businesses by becoming one of the first to get a new special license called the BitLicense to run a virtual currency company in New York. In addition to providing the brokerage service for small investors Coinbase also runs an exchange called GDAX which is tailored to larger investors. What are cryptocurrencies? “Cryptocurrencies” is a term referring to the various virtual currencies that have been developed since Bitcoin was created. The most well-known cryptocurrencies are Ether Dogecoin and Tether. Ether is the virtual currency used on the global computing network Ethereum which operates according to rules defined by Ethereum software. Those rules allow the Ethereum network to be programmed to complete certain types of computing tasks with every computer on the network completing the tasks simultaneously to ensure they are done correctly. Generally the tasks involve money. The creator of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin has likened the network to a global smartphone that can be programmed to operate according to the apps built on top of it. The apps are called Dapps because they are run by a decentralized network of computers. Mr. Buterin was inspired by Bitcoin's success to create Ethereum. But he set out to build something that could do more than Bitcoin: He wanted to build a system that would make it possible to program more complex financial transactions. With Ethereum two companies can conduct transactions such as settling a stock option on a shared computer that allows them both to check the records. Dogecoin was created as a parody of cryptocurrency in 2013 by two friends who had met in a chat room. Named after a meme of an expressive dog Dogecoin was meant to mock the self-serious cryptocurrencies of the time many of which never took off. The joke did though and it spawned a community of enthusiasts who have kept it alive for years. Tether is the largest stablecoin a type of cryptocurrency that is typically pegged to an existing government-backed currency. It is roughly half-invested in a type of short-term corporate debt called commercial paper. Show more ADVERTISEMENT  What is DeFi? Decentralized Finance or DeFi refers to the universe of alternative financial services spawned by the development of cryptocurrencies. DeFi is an umbrella term for the part of the crypto universe that is geared toward building a new internet-native financial system using blockchains to replace traditional intermediaries like banks and trust mechanisms. It has allowed crypto businesses to move into more traditional banking territory offering services such as lending and borrowing. Investors can earn interest on their holdings of digital currencies — often a lot more than they could on cash deposits in a bank — or borrow with crypto as collateral to back a loan. Crypto loans generally involve no credit checks since transactions are backed by digital assets. To send or receive money in the traditional financial system you need intermediaries like banks or stock exchanges. In DeFi those middlemen are replaced by software. As people trade directly with one another blockchain-based “smart contracts” do the work of making markets settling trades and ensuring that the entire process is fair and trustworthy. What is an NFT? A nonfungible token or NFT is a digital asset that establishes authenticity and ownership and can be verified on a blockchain network. An NFT is basically a way to claim ownership of a digital file: You can think of it as a certificate of authenticity you might get if you buy an expensive sculpture. The sculpture can be copied forged or even stolen but because you have the certificate of authenticity you can theoretically prove that you are the owner of the original. NFTs make digital artworks unique and therefore sellable. Artists musicians influencers and sports franchises can use them to monetize digital goods that were previously cheap or free. The technology also responds to the art world's need for authentication and provenance in an increasingly digital world permanently linking a digital file to its creator. The technology for NFTs has been around since the mid-2010s but became mainstream in late 2017 with CryptoKitties a site that allowed people to buy and “breed” limited-edition digital cats with cryptocurrency. Since then investors have begun buying and trading NFTs often for eye-popping prices. What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is typically pegged to a stable asset like the dollar or another government-backed currency. To promise holders that every $1 they put in will remain worth $1 stablecoin issuers hold a bundle of assets in reserve usually short-term securities such as cash government debt or commercial paper. Stablecoins are useful because they help lock in value at the time of transaction. This is important since cryptocurrencies are volatile and prone to price fluctuations. They form a bridge between traditional money and crypto and are exploding in popularity as a practical and cheap way to make transactions in cryptocurrency. But many stablecoins are built more like slightly risky investments than like the dollars-and-cents cash they claim to be. And so far they are slipping through regulatory cracks. Regulators are concerned about stablecoins because they have exploded in popularity very quickly and because many are backed by traditional reserves they could and trigger a kind of bank run that would potentially pose risks in the wider financial system. There is also no consistent oversight of issuers or a standard for reserves and as such different stablecoin issuers have different types of reserve backing including more or less cash treasuries commercial paper etc. There are a few kinds of stablecoins including these digital assets backed by traditional reserves others are collateralized by crypto and finally algorithmic stablecoins. The risk in algorithmic stablecoins — which depend on a mathematical formula devised by issuers and investor interest to maintain stability — was demonstrated in May when Terra/Luna crashed after the assumptions the algorithm was premised on did not pan out in the market and investors fled. ADVERTISEMENT  What is web3? “Web3” is a term some technologists use to describe the idea of a new version of the web made up of blockchain-based platforms and services fueled by cryptocurrency. At its core web3 aims to replace centralized corporate platforms with open protocols and decentralized community-run networks. The term has been around for years but it has become trendy in the past year or so. Packy McCormick an investor who helped popularize web3 has defined it as “the internet owned by the builders and users orchestrated with tokens.” Web3 is seen as the next evolution of web1 (the era in the 1990s and early 2000s during which the internet was made up of blogs message boards and early portals like AOL and CompuServe) and web2 (a phase starting around 2005 or so characterized by social media behemoths like Facebook Twitter and YouTube). Proponents envision that web3 will take many forms including decentralized social networks “play-to-earn” video games that reward players with crypto tokens and NFT platforms that allow people to buy and sell pieces of digital culture. The more idealistic ones say web3 will transform the internet as we know it upending traditional gatekeepers and ushering in a new middleman-free digital economy. But some critics believe that web3 is little more than a rebranding effort for crypto with the aim of shedding crypto's reputation as a place for rogues and rebels and convincing people that blockchains are the next phase of computing. Others believe it's a dystopian vision of a pay-to-play internet in which every activity and social interaction becomes a financial instrument to be bought and sold.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/01/opinion/blockchains-what-are-they-good-for.html,02/12/22,A year ago Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were selling at record prices with a combined market value of around $3 trillion; glossy ads featuring celebrities  most infamously Matt Damons Fortune Favors the Brave-filled the airwaves. Politicians including alas the mayor of New York raced to align themselves with what seemed to be the coming thing. Skeptics like yours truly were told that we just didn't get it. Since then the prices of crypto assets have plunged while a growing number of crypto institutions have collapsed amid allegations of scandal. The implosion of FTX which appears to have used depositors' money in an attempt to prop up a related trading firm has made the most headlines but it's only one entry on a growing list. We are many people say going through a crypto winter.But that may understate the case. This is looking more and more like Fimbulwinter the endless winter that in Norse mythology precedes the end of the world -in this case the crypto world not just cryptocurrencies but the whole idea of organizing economic life around the famous blockchain.And the real question it seems to me is why so many people -not just naÃ¯ve small investors but also major financial and business players -bought into the belief that this bad idea was the wave of the future. A blockchain is a digital ledger associated with an asset recording the history of transactions in that asset -who bought it from whom and so on. The asset could be a digital token like a Bitcoin but it could also be a stock or even a physical thing like a shipping container. Ledgers of course are nothing new. What's distinctive about blockchains is that the ledgers are supposed to be decentralized: They aren't sitting on the computers of a single bank or other company; they're in the public domain sustained by protocols that induce many people to maintain records on many servers. These protocols are everyone tells me extremely clever. I'll take their word for it. The question I've never heard or seen satisfactorily answered however is What's the point?Why go to the trouble and expense of maintaining a ledger in many places and basically carrying that ledger around every time a transaction takes place?

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/24/opinion/crypto-blockchain-nfts.html,01/24/22,My family managed to get together for a small Thanksgiving dinner last year. It was our first gathering since April 2020. After a big meal my cousin only wanted to talk about one thing: cryptocurrency. He is a middle-aged Black man from New York just a few years older than I am but those years make a huge difference in his job security. When he came of age he got a blue-collar job working for the city. He has worked at that job since he was 17 years old so he will be able to retire as a relatively young man. And since the job is unionized my cousin will retire with a pension and health benefits -the kind of pathway to economic security that is becoming increasingly rare. These days ours is an information economy that likes credentials which involves going to some kind of postsecondary school. Even with high wages for skilled trades like the one my cousin used to get that union job straight after high school blue-collar trades are a hard sell to young workers. My cousin is not exactly a dinosaur but he is not the kind of guy you imagine day-trading or actively managing an investment portfolio. Yet he is absolutely enthused about Bitcoin. While he is figuring out his second act he views crypto as the way to build generational wealthand freedom.I put those words in quotes because you hear them a lot in conversations around financial-sector schemes and I am not sure they mean anything in those contexts. This week the New York mayor Eric Adams is living up to his campaign promise to get his first three paychecks converted to cryptocurrency. My blue-collar cousin has a lot in common with his mayor. The allure of the next American frontier crosses all kinds of lines including class lines. I'll get to that in a second. Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency but there are many others like Ethereum Dogecoin and Tether which come up a lot among my peers. Some people talk about crypto as being revolutionary because it promises to democratize access to financial markets and give individual investors control of their destiny. In an adjacent space nonfungible tokens -or NFTs -promise something similar. NFTs are like coupons that represent an underlying object like a piece of artwork although they could represent almost anything. For my part the discussion over Thanksgiving leftovers brought home a data point about women's and people of color's interest in cryptocurrency. A 2021 survey found that the people who trade crypto are a far cry from the young white male image of a techbro: The average cryptocurrency trader is under 40 (mean age is 38) and does not have a college degree (55 percent). Two-fifths of crypto traders are not white (44 percent) and 41 percent are women. That survey captured a lot of people like my cousin. What fascinates me is how widely crypto and NFT talk has diffused and so quickly. It is not often that I hear the same branding from lower-income people of color that I also hear from high-earning white peers with advanced degrees. Depending on your consumer profile -biographical data like your age race and gender plus your purchasing habits -you probably hear about these financial instruments from online ads social media groups and peers who are early adopters. I hear about crypto from my educated high-income academic and writing friends who also shop at Target a lot. I also hear about crypto from financial advisers and college classmates who share stories about making a lot of money mining crypto and trading NFTs. But because of my racial and geographic identities I also hear about crypto from my working-class friends and family. They are getting messages about crypto from Facebook and Instagram and their friends who have moved on from candle-leggings-timeshare-jewelry multilevel marketing schemes to trading Dogecoin. Crypto and NFTs might be the only thing these diverse groups share in common. For that reason alone the explosion of these technologies deserves some sociological attention.

But some critics question whether the new tools present a true opportunity or a threat. Predatory inclusionis the concept of increased access to products or services -only on exploitative or dangerous terms that in fact undermine the potential benefits. The phrase has been applied to housing and education loans targeting minorities. Increasingly, it also comes up in discussions of crypto, said the veteran tech journalist and New York Times Opinion podcaster Kara Swisher at a task force on the future of money at the DealBook D.C. policy forum last week.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/20/business/lvmh-richemont-prada-blockchain.html,04/20/21,"Three rival names in the European luxury sector have established a new blockchain consortium that will allow shoppers to track the provenance of their purchases and authenticate goods. LVMH  Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which first unveiled plans for a global blockchain-based system in 2019, will be joined by Prada Group and Compagnie Financière Richemont in the Aura Blockchain Consortium, a nonprofit group that will promote the use of a single blockchain solution open to all luxury brands worldwide. Many sectors are looking at the possibility of using blockchain, the distributed ledger system that underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Because blockchains are unchangeable and decentralized, the data stored on them is trustworthy and secure. In this case, each product will be given a unique digital code during the manufacturing process that will be recorded on the Aura ledger. When customers make a purchase, they will be given login details to a platform that will provide the history of the product, including its origin, components, environmental and ethical information, proof of ownership, a warranty and care instructions. Bulgari, Cartier, Hublot, Louis Vuitton and Prada are already using the system, with advanced conversationsbeing held with a number of other luxury brands, according to a statement released Tuesday. Participating luxury brands pay an annual licensing fee and a volume fee. Aura, based in Geneva, was developed in partnership with Microsoft and ConsenSys, a blockchain software technology company in New York. The Aura Consortium represents an unprecedented cooperation in the luxury industry,said Cartier's chief executive, Cyrille Vigneron, adding that he invited the entire professionto join the consortium. The luxury industry creates timeless pieces and must ensure that these rigorous standards will endure and remain in trustworthy hands,he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/opinion/crypto-terra-luna-blockchain.html,06/16/22,"This week, the crypto market plummeted for the second time in a month, in tandem with a sharp drop in global stock markets. The collapse, not the first of its kind, showed again how the violent swings of a largely unregulated market warp the development of a transformative technology. But crypto is just one aspect of the larger blockchain universe. Its skeptics and fans alike must learn to see it as a technological experiment, instead of just a blatant scam or a speculative path to riches. Why has the market fallen apart in such spectacular fashion? The first recent crash, when the cryptocurrency market plunged 36 percent in a week in May, offers a clue. The collapse was largely set off by the death spiral of a cryptocurrency system called Terra Luna, made up of the coin Luna and its associated stablecoin, TerraUSD. At its dizzying heights in the spring, it represented roughly 3 percent of the total crypto market. Fear spread throughout the exchanges, and with it came panic selling. After the second crash this week, the cryptocurrency market is still worth in total nearly $1 trillion (about one-third of last November's peak). Only a few of the 19,000 cryptocurrencies that have been created since 2009 are now worth billions. Most have failed. The crypto market is wildly volatile not because of cryptocurrency's underlying technology, but because of the uneasy and often dangerously unstable junction between emerging technologies and regular money. Viewed from the long perspective of market history, this instability isn't remotely new. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, internet stocks were a white-knuckle ride, just as crypto is now. Back then, too, hucksterism was rampant, the atmosphere was like a casino, and almost any idea with an ein front of it -no matter how reckless or silly -attracted attention from investors and the news media. Seemingly every day, fortunes were spectacularly made and lost. But even as Napster, Webvan and eToys flamed out, a revolution was taking place. Despite all the shenanigans going on in the casino, real and lasting companies, publications and communities were built and thrived online. The internet survived, more or less. Terraform Labs, the company behind TerraUSD and Luna, was founded in 2018 by Do Kwon, a computer scientist and entrepreneur in South Korea. Mr. Kwon, now 30, is a notoriously brazen hustler who has made waves for calling his critics poorand cockroaches.But despite his lack of polish, and the early warnings from developers and analysts about the technical weaknesses of his plans, he succeeded in raising $200 million in venture capital from 2018 to 2021. His company boasted of reaching an elusive goal in crypto, namely, the establishment of a truly decentralizedstablecoin. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/us/bitcoin-arkansas-noise-pollution.html,02/03/24,"On a sweltering July evening, the din from thousands of computers mining for Bitcoins pierced the night. Nearby, Matt Brown, a member of the Arkansas legislature, monitored the noise alongside a local magistrate. As the two men investigated complaints about the operation, Mr. Brown said, a security guard for the mine loaded rounds into an AR-15-style assault rifle that had been stored in a car. He wanted to make sure that we knew he had his gun -that we knew it was loaded,Mr. Brown, a Republican, said in an interview. The Bitcoin outfit here, 45 minutes north of Little Rock, is one of three sites in Arkansas owned by a network of companies embroiled in tense disputes with residents, who say the noise generated by computers performing trillions of calculations per second ruins lives, lowers property values and drives away wildlife. Scores of the operations have popped up in recent years across the United States. When a mining computer lands on numbers that Bitcoin's algorithm accepts, the payout is currently worth about a quarter-million dollars. The more computers an operation has, the better chance of earning the payout. The industry is often criticized for its vast energy use -often a boon for the fossil-fuel industry -and noise is a common complaint. Though some elected officials like Mr. Brown and other Bitcoin operators in Arkansas have voiced support for the beleaguered residents, a new state law has given the companies a significant leg up.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/24/us/politics/justice-dept-cryptocurrency-north-korea.html,04/24/23,"WASHINGTON The Justice Department said on Monday that it had indicted four men on charges of laundering virtual currency stolen by an infamous North Korean online criminal syndicate as part of a far-reaching scheme to buy goods with U.S. dollars and evade international sanctions. The charges, filed in three cases in federal court in Washington, outline a complex multiyear effort to launder cryptocurrency obtained by the Lazarus Group, an organization linked to espionage, online theft and cyberattacks, including the 2014 breach of Sony Pictures. The scheme involved a relatively modest amount of currency. But it represents only a fraction of the illegal activity being undertaken by North Korea, officials said -and it vividly demonstrated the creativity and resolve of an isolated country intent on defying demands that it abandon its nuclear weapons and long-range missile programs. In the first indictment, the government charged a banker based in China, Sim Hyon Sop, 39, along with three cryptocurrency traders with conspiring to convert virtual currency that had been stolen from accounts into dollars. North Korea's government, short on cash, later used the money to buy goods, including tobacco and communications equipment, in 2018. The second indictment outlined a related conspiracy by Mr. Sim, and various North Korean information technology workers who used fake identities to get jobs with blockchain companies in the United States. Several workers, and others not named in court papers, used that access to launder about $12 million that passed through Mr. Sim's cryptocurrency wallet, prosecutors said. A third indictment describes an unlicensed money-transmitting business that conducted over 1,500 trades for U.S. customers without the necessary licenses.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/21/arts/design-nft-quantum-lawsuit-dismiss-mccoy.html,03/21/23,"A federal court last Friday dismissed a lawsuit that questioned the ownership rules around an NFT called Quantum,which Sotheby's sold for $1.47 million in 2021 as the first of its kind. The legal battle had become part of a larger effort to define rules of ownership for digital artworks. A Canadian company named Free Holdings brought the complaint last year against the auction house and the artist, Kevin McCoy, who created the artwork in 2014 as a demonstration of the blockchain's potential to register artworks on a digital ledger system. The artwork itself looks like something from a science-fiction movie, as if it were an alien wormhole pulsing with neon colors. The dispute arose because the blockchain system that McCoy used for Quantumalso required him to periodically renew his ownership rights. (Most web domains operate by similar rules.) But the artist neglected to renew terms of ownership, which allowed Free Holdings to purchase the registration and assert ownership over the work itself. The company subsequently accused Sotheby's and McCoy of slander and commercial disparagement. James Cott, a magistrate judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, dismissed the case and wrote that Free Holdings had failed to establish its claims of ownership and injury. Free Holdings has demonstrated nothing more than an attempt to exploit open questions of ownership in the still-developing NFT field to lay claim to the profits of a legitimate artist,Judge Cott said in his dismissal. William Charron, an attorney representing McCoy, said in an email that he believed the judge's decision would clear some confusion in the market. The significance of this case is that it prevented a party from using somewhat obscure blockchain usage rules to appropriate the work-product of an artist,Charron explained.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/arts/design/fairchain-artists-resale-royalties.html,03/23/22,"Even before the artist Robert Rauschenberg famously objected to seeing a 1958 painting he originally sold for $900 flip for $85,000 in 1973, artists have been frustrated by not receiving royalties for their work when it changes hands. Previous efforts to address this over the years have failed. But now, as musicians and other creative producers assert more control over their future sales and blockchain technology has allowed for easier tracking of intellectual property, two Stanford alumni have started a business to help visual artists reap the financial rewards when their work is resold privately or comes up for auction, in some cases at many multiples of the original price. There has been exponential growth in the secondary market, but artists have largely been left behind, even though they are essential to it,Max Kendrick, one of the founders, said. How do we create a more sustainable model for the artist and the galleries that support them?Charlie Jarvis, 24, a computer scientist, and Kendrick, 36, a former diplomat and a son of the sculptor Mel Kendrick, started the company, called Fairchain, in 2019. Little by little, it is gaining traction with artists and gallerists. If widely adopted, as it should be, it could be pretty revolutionary,said the artist Hank Willis Thomas, an adviser to the company. So many artists who died poor spent their whole career giving away what they produced. In the music industry, it's expected,Thomas added. I have friends on 'Law and Order' who, after 20 years, are still getting royalty checks.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/12/arts/design/nft-collectors-artwork.html,02/12/22,"Felix Xu started his NFT art collection by purchasing a Chromie Squiggle, generated by an algorithm. Today, Xu, a 29-year-old Chinese tech executive, has more than 3,000 blockchain-based collectibles. But there is a hole burning in his crypto wallet that he would like to fill with real paintings. His budget stretches toward $500,000 and he is already on the wait-list for in-demand artists who use paint and moving brushes like Zhang Zipiao. So in December, Xu, a founder and chief executive of the start-ups Arpa and Bella Protocol, ventured through the gallery booths of Art Basel Miami Beach, where dealers from David Zwirner and Pace Gallery tried bending his ear toward the contemporary art market. He was looking for an education; they were looking for a sale. I was really amazed with all the sculptures and paintings,Xu said in an interview, crediting the fair with expanding his interest from blue-chip modernists like Picasso toward living artists like Nigel Cooke and Jessie Makinson. Xu is among the increasing number of NFT collectors looking to invest their cryptocurrency in something tangible: a traditional art collection, starting with the painting he bought in January by Renqian Yang, a Chinese artist living in New York. Critics have scoffed that a marriage between NFTs and the art world is impossible. But catering to the tastes of the crypto nouveau riche has become the frantic obsession of the commercial art world, which is reshaping itself around these new collectors nearly a year after artists like Beeple and Pak sold NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, for tens of millions of dollars, inspiring the typically technophobic art industry to head into the metaverse.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/14/arts/design/nft-art-market-sothebys.html,04/14/22,"When digital artworks started selling for millions of dollars last year, the shock of pixelated punks and computerized graphics turned some traditional collectors into crypto skeptics. The argument that NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, represented the art market's future was unappealing to the bulk of these buyers, leaving gallerists and auctioneers to focus their attention on a new class of millennial connoisseurs from the tech world. The arrangement left auction houses prioritizing Pak cubes and Bored Apes -collectibles that are the closest one can get to brand-names in the crypto world -in sales that further alienated the skeptics. But one year later, Sotheby's has started using the more genteel language of art history to entice traditional collectors toward blockchain-based collectibles for a sale, Natively Digital NFT. It is running April 18-25 and is designed to unite early pioneers of computer art with their crypto counterparts. Traditional collectors are often drawn to provenance and pedigree, so a sale focused on the lineage of computer art might help convince them that NFT artists have a stronger art historical foundation beyond the beep and boop of internet forums. The event features some of the earliest examples of generative art, a genre where control of the creative process is determined by algorithms or a predetermined process to create images. Examples include artists working in the 1960s and 1970s like Vera Molnar, Chuck Csuri and Roman Verostko alongside more recent offerings from the digital artists Dmitri Cherniak, Tyler Hobbs and Anna Ridler.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/02/opinion/twitter-remote-work.html,12/02/21,"There has been a whirlwind of commentary about all the changes at Twitter, and especially around its persistently quirky co-founder Jack Dorsey (whose world I am dubbing the Jackaverse). Besides suddenly stepping down as chief executive and chairman of Twitter, he made waves over at his other day job, leading the payments company he co-founded called Square, and changed its corporate name to Block. This is not just fun with shapes; the new name is meant to refer to the blockchain. (Do not make me explain what the blockchain is.) Not to get all meta on you as  the company tweeted, making an allusion to another recent corporate name change. Block references the neighborhood blocks where we find our sellers, a blockchain, block parties full of music, obstacles to overcome, a section of code, building blocks, and of course, tungsten cubes. Tungsten cubes? For those who are not in the know, these are dense metal blocks (get it??!?) that have become an obsession among the cryptorati. (Look, I just made up a word!) These folks like to hold the cubes and have been buying them like there is no tomorrow. A two-inch tungsten cube weighs over five pounds, so it's like a toddler toy for grown-ups. Cooool. Speaking of which, all these seemingly separate moves seem to indicate that Twitter could itself be on the block (ha) soon enough, as Scott Galloway posited on the weekly Twitter Spaces chat I co-host with Casey Newton of Platformer. I have been writing about buyout interest for a while, including in 2016 when Salesforce, Google and even Disney kicked Twitter tires. As I noted back then: Why not take a gander, given the huge trove of data that Twitter sits atop globally and its unique worldwide digital distribution system? While company execs have been unable to grow the business, many think a link with a larger entity would spur Twitter potential. That you could write that very same sentence today says it all, since Twitter stock has been dead in the water for years. Shares sold for around $42 in November 2013, and today they are trading for around, you guessed it, $42. This is even as other tech companies valuations have soared during the pandemic. Twitter is a fine and famous asset that is woefully undervalued. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.
