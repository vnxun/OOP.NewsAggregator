A range of players have embraced crypto, from individual speculators to major financial institutions, despite how volatile they are.. Some have generated vast riches, while others have destroyed huge amounts of wealth. When people talk about crypto, they may be referring to one of many different ideas and companies. The industry is booming and spawning an abundance of projects and new terms to go with them. The topic can be confusing, but the concept has also become ubiquitous. Learning the right terminology can help. Jump to: What is a Bitcoin? What is Bitcoin mining? What is a blockchain? What is Coinbase? What are cryptocurrencies? What is DeFi? What is an NFT? What is a stablecoin? What is web3? What is a Bitcoin? A Bitcoin is a digital token that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world. A Bitcoin can be divided out to eight decimal places, so you can send someone 0.00000001 Bitcoin. This smallest fraction of a Bitcoin ˚} the penny of the Bitcoin world ˚} is referred to as a Satoshi, named after the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is also the name of the payment network on which this form of digital currency is stored and moved. Unlike traditional payment networks such as Visa, the Bitcoin network is not run by a single company or person. The system is run by a decentralized network of computers around the world that keep track of all Bitcoin transactions, similar to the way Wikipedia is maintained by a decentralized network of writers and editors. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a creator who goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, who communicated with the rest of the world only by email and social messaging. While several people have been identified as possibly being Satoshi, the identity of the real Satoshi has not been confirmed. Satoshi created the original rules of the Bitcoin network and then shared the software with the rest of the world in 2009. The inventor largely disappeared from the public two years later. Once Satoshi had released the software, anyone could download and use it. This means Satoshi has no more control over the network now than anyone else. What is Bitcoin mining? Bitcoin mining refers to the process through which new Bitcoins are created and given to computers helping to maintain the network. The computers involved in Bitcoin mining are in a sort of computational race to process new transactions coming onto the network, solving complex math problems that require quintillions of numerical guesses per second. The winner of that race ˚} generally the person with the fastest computers ˚} gets a chunk of new Bitcoins. Since miners can earn rewards but are independent, this process is meant to incentivize participation and maintenance. There is generally a new winner about every 10 minutes, and this will continue until there are 21 million Bitcoins in the world. At that point, no new Bitcoins will be created. The network is expected to reach that cap in 2140. Every Bitcoin in existence was created through this method and initially given to a computer helping to maintain the records. In Bitcoin˚}s early years, a crypto enthusiast could mine coins by running software on a laptop. But as the digital assets have become more popular, the amount of power necessary to win the race and generate Bitcoins has soared. A single Bitcoin transaction now requires more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, or enough energy to sustain the average U.S. household for 73 days, according to some estimates. ADVERTISEMENT SKIP ADVERTISEMENT What is a blockchain? A blockchain is a database that is maintained communally and that reliably stores digital information. The original blockchain was the database on which all Bitcoin transactions were stored. It was named ÅE}blockchainÅE} because the transactions coming onto the network were grouped into blocks of data and then chained together using sophisticated math. After the Bitcoin blockchain had operated for a number of years, successfully storing every Bitcoin transaction and surviving numerous attacks from hackers, many programmers and entrepreneurs wondered if its design could be replicated to create other kinds of secure ledgers unrelated to Bitcoin. Companies and governments that donÅE}t rely on currency have since begun using blockchain technology to store their data. Banks are building blockchains that can track payments between accounts, while governments are experimenting with using blockchains to store property records and votes. What is Coinbase? Coinbase is a platform that allows people and companies to buy and sell various digital currencies, including Bitcoin, for a transa",Explain,Related to Blockchain,,The New York Times

The collapse, not the first of its kind, showed again how the violent swings of a largely unregulated market warp the development of a transformative technology. But crypto is just one aspect of the larger blockchain universe. Its skeptics and fans alike must learn to see it as a technological experiment, instead of just a blatant scam or a speculative path to riches. Why has the market fallen apart in such spectacular fashion? The first recent crash, when the cryptocurrency market plunged 36 percent in a week in May, offers a clue. The collapse was largely set off by the death spiral of a cryptocurrency system called Terra Luna, made up of the coin Luna and its associated stablecoin, TerraUSD. At its dizzying heights in the spring, it represented roughly 3 percent of the total crypto market. Fear spread throughout the exchanges, and with it came panic selling.

But now, as musicians and other creative producers assert more control over their future sales and blockchain technology has allowed for easier tracking of intellectual property, two Stanford alumni have started a business to help visual artists reap the financial rewards when their work is resold privately or comes up for auction, in some cases at many multiples of the original price.

The collapse, not the first of its kind, showed again how the violent swings of a largely unregulated market warp the development of a transformative technology. But crypto is just one aspect of the larger blockchain universe. Its skeptics and fans alike must learn to see it as a technological experiment, instead of just a blatant scam or a speculative path to riches. Why has the market fallen apart in such spectacular fashion? The first recent crash, when the cryptocurrency market plunged 36 percent in a week in May, offers a clue. The collapse was largely set off by the death spiral of a cryptocurrency system called Terra Luna, made up of the coin Luna and its associated stablecoin, TerraUSD. At its dizzying heights in the spring, it represented roughly 3 percent of the total crypto market. Fear spread throughout the exchanges, and with it came panic selling.

But do brand loyalists really want NFTs?,"It would probably be a stretch to say that Ty Haney changed the way we work out. She did not start a boutique fitness craze; she is not Jane Fonda. But Outdoor Voices, the athleisure company she founded in 2014, helped to popularize a fitness paradigm that has more to do with everyday movement than the body-stressing athleticism advertised by brands like Nike. Outdoor Voices built a following with color-blocked compression leggings and all-in-one exercise dresses that could easily transition from gym to brunch. On social media, fans boasted about buying items in every shade and posted pictures of themselves #DoingThings in scenic locales while wearing matching sets. They also shared feedback on new styles and colorways in online forums. It was a customer-loyalty fairy tale. Though she is no longer with Outdoor Voices, Ms. Haney, 33, is hoping to bring its tenets of community building and consumer engagement into a new sphere: the blockchain-based future of the internet known as web3. She is betting that in the next phase of online retail, minting things will be the new doing things.Her latest venture, a platform called Try Your Best, will enable brands to collect input from customers in exchange for rewards such as digital collectibles (NFTs) and brand coins that can be used for bragging rights or toward purchases. These are assets, Ms. Haney said, that could potentially have lasting value, as opposed to the one-time discount codes and fleeting perks most companies offer loyalists. The idea is that brands and fans build together, and the concept is to share value with those who create it, Ms. Haney said in an interview. Direct-to-consumer brands have typically relied on disparate sources to solicit feedback from their most engaged customers: Google Docs, Slack bases, DMs. Try Your Best aims to streamline that process, and to route marketing dollars away from Facebook and Instagram, where Ms. Haney said that soaring costs have made it harder for emerging brands to grow.

By Jonah Engel Bromwich Civil Media Company was introduced earlier this year as both a media platform and a network, to be owned and operated by journalists and concerned citizens in tandem. It was an exciting proposal.

He has pledged to give city employees the option of converting their paychecks into Bitcoin and has outlined plans to install a digital mining network in a deserted wing of City Hall. The aim, he said, is to make Jackson a Southeastern tech center. Like many Americans, Mr. Conger discovered crypto during the pandemic and soon fell down an internet rabbit hole.

People who receive benefits from Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, the Railroad Retirement Board and Veterans Affairs ˚}˚}˚} but do not file tax returns because they don˚}˚}˚}t meet the income thresholds ˚}˚}˚} were among those who faced delays. But most of them ˚}˚}˚} with the exception of those receiving benefits from Veterans Affairs ˚}˚}˚} could have their payments arrive by direct deposit on April 7, as long as there are no further problems. Veterans Affairs beneficiaries will have to wait a bit longer; the I.R.S. estimates their checks could be issued by mid-April and expects to provide more specifics soon. The payments have been delayed because the I.R.S. didn˚}˚}˚}t have the proper files to process them until last week. The agency said on Tuesday that it had begun a ˚}˚}˚}multi-step process˚}˚}˚} to check the beneficiaries˚}˚}˚} eligibility and calculate their payments. Individuals can check the status of their payment on the Get My Payment tool on the I.R.S. website ˚}˚}˚} it˚}˚}˚}s updated for eligible individuals once their payment has been processed. But the agency said that the tool would not be updated until the weekend of April 3-4 with information for federal beneficiaries expecting payments next week. But many federal beneficiaries who filed tax returns in 2019 or 2020 ˚}˚}˚} or who used the I.R.S.˚}˚}˚}s non-filers tool last year ˚}˚}˚} have already received their payments over the past three weeks. ˚}˚}˚} Tara Siegel Bernard No, Volkswagen is not renaming itself Voltswagen. Image The stunt comes as the company is promoting its new ID.4 electric S.U.V. in the United States.Credit...Ronny Hartmann/Agence France-Presse ˚}˚}˚} Getty Images Contrary to what you may have read, Volkswagen has not changed its name. The company˚}˚}˚}s U.S. operation caused a stir with an announcement on its website that it planned to call itself Voltswagen to emphasize its push into electric vehicles as it rolls out its first electric sport-utility vehicle in the United States ˚}˚}˚} the ID.4. The change came ahead of April Fool˚}˚}˚}s day ˚}˚}˚} a favorite time of year for companies to try to grab a share of the social media conversation, such as when IHOP tried to convince the world it was changing its last letter to B, as in burgers. ˚}˚}˚}At the end of the day, it was a bit of fun with the name and the brand,˚}˚}˚} a Volkswagen spokesman, Mark Gillies, said. ˚}˚}˚}We wanted to reinforce what we are messaging about the ID.4.˚}˚}˚} Word of the name change surfaced on Monday when a news release announcing the name change was published on the company˚}˚}˚}s website for about an hour before disappearing. CNBC, USA Today and others reported on the news release, saying it was dated April 29 and appeared to have been accidentally posted a month early. On Tuesday, the company posted a new statement dated March 30 about the name change, raising a flurry of comments and speculation on social media. Late Tuesday afternoon, Volkswagen officials in Germany, where the company is based, acknowledged it was a marketing tactic. The company˚}˚}˚}s Twitter account was changed Tuesday morning to show a logo with the new name, but the company˚}˚}˚}s website continued to use the old name. The new name was written in a fluorescent blue typeface similar to the font General Motors chose for a new logo it unveiled in January. G.M.˚}˚}˚}s logo was intended to have the same effect ˚}˚}˚} to emphasize its commitment to electric vehicles. G.M. has said it aims to make only electric vehicles by 2035. Volkswagen has said it will no longer develop new gasoline engines a few years from now. Volkswagen needs to make a splash if it wants to sell a lot of electric cars in the United States. Tesla dominates the market for now, while Ford Motor has gained ground with the Mustang Mach-E electric S.U.V. that has been delivered to several thousand drivers. Changing the name of an automaker as established as Volkswagen would clearly be a huge undertaking, and not just for the company. Its dealers would have to spend millions of dollars to rebrand their franchises. ˚}˚}˚}I don˚}˚}˚}t know anything about it,˚}˚}˚} said Jason Kuhn, owner of two Voltswagen, nee Volkswagen, dealerships near Tampa, Fla. said on Tuesday before the company admitted it was just having fun. ˚}˚}˚}I˚}˚}˚}ve read it.

Video transcript Back bars 0:00/1:17 -0:00 transcript Psaki Defends Cap on Immigration Set by Trump Administration The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, defended the administration˚}˚}˚}s decision to cap the number of refugees allowed into the country. Ms. Psaki said the Biden administration planned to raise the cap by May 15. Last week˚}˚}˚}s announcement or Friday˚}˚}˚}s announcement, I should say, was an effort, an important step forward in our view, to reverse the Trump policy that banned refugees from many key regions of the world. We we have every intention to increase the cap and to make an announcement of that by May 15 at the latest. And I expect it will be sooner than that. The president also remains committed to pursuing the aspirational goal of reaching 125,000 refugees by the end of the next fiscal year. We never said, we˚}˚}˚}re not raising the refugee cap. In the morning we said actually, and with the information we put out, was that once we reach 15,000, we will raise it. That was not accounted for, and some of, how people were ˚}˚}˚} let me finish ˚}˚}˚} some of how people were digesting the information, and we want it to be clear and send a message that we are a country that is welcoming refugees. Let˚}˚}˚}s be clear. We are changing the policies of the last administration. We are changing the policy of not welcoming in people from Africa or people from the Middle East. That was the biggest factor, preventing refugees from coming in during the last administration. The battle is not the cap. The issue has been the limitations that have been put in place in the past. We overturned those and changed those, and it was always meant to be a first step.

Ms. Psaki said the Biden administration planned to raise the cap by May 15.CreditCredit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, on Monday defended the administration˚}˚}˚}s decision to keep the number of refugees allowed into the country at the level set by the Trump administration, a move last week that prompted immediate criticism by Democrats and an about-face by President Biden. Ms. Psaki said the Biden administration was still trying to figure out how to process more refugees and plans to raise the cap by May 15. ˚}˚}˚}The challenge is not the cap,˚}˚}˚} Ms. Psaki said while fielding questions from reporters on the issue for several minutes. ˚}˚}˚}The challenge is the ability to process.˚}˚}˚} The Biden administration for months has promised to raise the refugee ceiling. In his first foreign policy speech, on Feb. 4, Mr. Biden said he would raise the limit from 15,000 to 125,000 for the 2022 fiscal year. Later that month, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken notified Congress that the administration would allow up to 62,500 refugees into the United States for the rest of the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. The administration said at the time that ˚}˚}˚}grave humanitarian concerns˚}˚}˚} around the world justified raising the cap earlier than usual. But on Friday, the White House left the cap at 15,000. Mr. Biden did make some changes, such as scrapping a Trump-era classification system in the refugee program that restricted the number of African and Muslims who could secure refuge to the United States. Still, the news drew immediate criticism and within hours, the White House promised to announce a final, increased number by May 15. ˚}˚}˚}The admission of up to 15,000 refugees remains justified by humanitarian concerns and is otherwise in the national interest,˚}˚}˚} Mr. Biden wrote in an executive memorandum released Friday. Ms. Psaki said on Monday that the order also said that the cap could be increased in the future. Asked on Monday whether administration officials should have assessed whether or not they would have the capacity to accommodate a large number of refugees before beginning to make announcements about raising the refugee cap, Ms. Psaki bristled, saying, ˚}˚}˚}People weren˚}˚}˚}t understanding what we were conveying to the public. We were conveying what we were trying to project to countries around the world.˚}˚}˚} ˚}˚}˚} Katie Rogers Biden meets with lawmakers of both parties to discuss infrastructure.

Follow our latest coverage of business, markets and economy. Stocks tumble in worst day since May, as tech shares slide and bond yields climb. By Coral Murphy Marcos The prospect of the Federal Reserve not reaching as deep into its bottomless pockets is starting to hit home for investors. The S&P 500 tumbled 2 percent on Tuesday ˚}˚}˚} the worst one-day slide for the benchmark U.S. index since May ˚}˚}˚} as investors faced the expected wind-down of the enormous bond purchases the central bank has made since the start of the pandemic. ˚}˚}˚}The deep sell-off highlights the extent of the nerves in the markets surrounding the moves of the Fed,˚}˚}˚} said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at Forex.com. The coming slowdown of bond purchases is a sign of the Fed˚}˚}˚}s confidence that the economy is recovering from the upheaval of the pandemic. But, Ms. Cincotta noted, other factors are still making Wall Street wary. ˚}˚}˚}There˚}˚}˚}s also a combination of rising energy prices, concerns that inflation could be more entrenched in these elevated levels and the fact that consumer confidence is slowing,˚}˚}˚} she said. The tumble extended into the Asian trading day on Wednesday, though investors signaled that confidence might be returning. Stocks in Japan were down more than 2.6 percent midday. But losses in other Asian markets, like Hong Kong and mainland China, were more moderate. Futures markets were signaling that Wall Street would open modestly higher. The trigger for Tuesday˚}˚}˚}s tumble, which cut across sectors, was a rise in the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note. With the Fed preparing to slow its purchases as soon as November, investors have been selling off bonds before demand ebbs. On Tuesday, that pushed the 10-year˚}˚}˚}s yield up to 1.54 percent, its highest level since June. Even though the Fed has said it doesn˚}˚}˚}t plan to increase interest rates for months or years, government bond yields are the basis for borrowing costs across the economy. When bond prices fall, yields rise ˚}˚}˚} a move that can hinder the stock market˚}˚}˚}s performance because it makes owning bonds more attractive and can discourage riskier investments. Tech stocks, which are particularly sensitive to the prospect of higher interest rates, were hit hard on Tuesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 2.8 percent, its biggest drop since February. Higher rates would make borrowing more expensive for smaller companies, and the jump in yields was a blow to shares of several high-flying stocks. Etsy, the online craft marketplace, dropped 6 percent, and Shopify fell more than 5 percent. Both companies have soared during the pandemic. ˚}˚}˚}With tech stocks, you˚}˚}˚}re betting for a company to have a breakthrough years from now,˚}˚}˚} said Beth Ann Bovino, the chief U.S. economist at S&P Global. ˚}˚}˚}If interest rates go up today, that value that you receive years from now is discounted.˚}˚}˚} The biggest technology stocks ˚}˚}˚} particularly Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google and Facebook ˚}˚}˚} have a vast pull on the broader market and helped drag down the S&P 500. Apple fell 2.4 percent and was the best performer of the tech giants. Amazon dropped 2.6 percent while Microsoft, Facebook and Google were down by more than 3.5 percent. But the declines cut across many sectors. Energy stocks were the exception, rallying after oil prices climbed early in the day. Schlumberger, ConocoPhillips, Halliburton and Exxon Mobil were among the best-performing shares in the S&P 500, though some of their gains faded as oil futures turned lower in the afternoon. The Delta variant of the virus remains a concern for investors, while persistent supply-chain bottlenecks have affected everything from auto production to school lunches. In Washington, lawmakers remain deeply divided over spending on infrastructure and expanding social programs. And another pressing fight is brewing over raising the nation˚}˚}˚}s debt limit ˚}˚}˚} a dispute that could trigger a government shutdown. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen warned lawmakers on Tuesday of ˚}˚}˚}catastrophic˚}˚}˚} consequences if Congress does not deal with the debt limit before Oct. 18. The unease is apparent in stock performance the past four weeks. The S&P 500 is approaching a 4 percent drop for September, ending seven straight months of gains. The winning streak had lifted stocks more than 20 percent, as investors seemed to largely shrug off any bad news. Bumpy moments have usually involved the Fed. Tuesday˚}˚}˚}s trading echoed the volatility of earlier this year, when a jump in rates roiled financial markets. That rise happened as traders worried that higher inflation might cause the Fed to increase rates sooner than officials had forecast. ˚}˚}˚}There˚}˚}˚}s no doubt that the equity market does not like higher rates ˚}˚}˚} there˚}˚}˚}s just no debate about it,˚}˚}˚} Ralph Axel, director of U.S. Rates Strategy at Bank of America. Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments, wrote in a note to clients that investors have begun seeking out safer investments while weighing concerns including the debt-ceiling fight and regulatory actions in China. The Chinese government has shown signs of sharply shifting away from the policies that have guided its economy for much of the last decade, tightening regulation on subjects like online gaming and data sharing by tech companies. And Beijing has so far been reluctant to bail out the teetering Evergrande Group, a beleaguered residential developer with $300 billion in debt, another shift from typical policy.

While there˚}˚}˚}s a hot debate about how to define a blockchain, most projects using the term try to create a single database that is shared and maintained by a group of people or institutions. The vast majority of blockchains involve new virtual currencies like Bitcoin. But corporations and governments around the world have also become interested in ways to use the technology to reliably store vast amounts of data. Here are some of the most ambitious blockchain projects companies and governments are working on. Public Blockchains Many new cryptocurrencies are like Bitcoin and record all transactions on public blockchains that anyone with a computer can help to update, without requiring permission from anyone. Public blockchains Blockchain-inspired cryptocurrencies Private blockchains Derived from the same blockchain Other relationship Bitcoin $105 MARKET CAP BIL. The original blockchain-based virtual currency has not lived up to its original goal of being a new online currency, but it has won favor as a scarce digital commodity similar to gold, giving rise to a vast global trading market.

Ethereum goes beyond Bitcoin to allow people to write so-called smart contracts into its blockchain, with the goal of creating a shared global computing system. The internal currency, Ether, can be used to pay for computing power. Several private blockchains have taken their basic design from the Ethereum software. Axcore The start-up Axoni has built its own version of Ethereum specifically designed for the financial industry. Autonity The British start-up Clearmatics has worked with several banks to build a so-called Utility Settlement Coin that banks can use to settle transactions between them. Ethereum private blockchain The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance has helped create several private versions of Ethereum and supported companies building applications on top of them. Quorum This closed variant of Ethereum was originally produced by a team at JPMorgan Chase, but has since gained use outside the financial industry. $45 Ethereum MARKET CAP BIL.

While there˚}˚}˚}s a hot debate about how to define a blockchain, most projects using the term try to create a single database that is shared and maintained by a group of people or institutions. The vast majority of blockchains involve new virtual currencies like Bitcoin. But corporations and governments around the world have also become interested in ways to use the technology to reliably store vast amounts of data. Here are some of the most ambitious blockchain projects companies and governments are working on. Public Blockchains Many new cryptocurrencies are like Bitcoin and record all transactions on public blockchains that anyone with a computer can help to update, without requiring permission from anyone.

Ethereum goes beyond Bitcoin to allow people to write so-called smart contracts into its blockchain, with the goal of creating a shared global computing system.

Credit...Andrew Kelly/Reuters By Stacy Cowley The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued the credit-reporting firm TransUnion and a former senior executive ˚}˚}˚} John Danaher, who led the company˚}˚}˚}s consumer sales unit ˚}˚}˚} for violating a 2017 order to stop using deceptive tactics to lure customers into recurring subscription payments. ˚}˚}˚}TransUnion is an out-of-control repeat offender that believes it is above the law,˚}˚}˚} said Rohit Chopra, the bureau˚}˚}˚}s director. After the 2017 order, TransUnion used hard-to-spot fine print on its website and enrollment forms to lure customers into recurring charges for its products, the bureau said. For example, TransUnion ran ads on annualcreditreport.com ˚}˚}˚} the official site where consumers can obtain one free credit report a year from each of the three major bureaus ˚}˚}˚} that, when clicked, diverted people to a sign-up form for paid credit monitoring, according to the bureau. Hundreds of people complained that they had tried to get their free annual report and instead ended up enrolled in a paid monthly subscription, the bureau said in a lawsuit filed on Tuesday in federal court in Chicago, where TransUnion is based. TransUnion said in a written statement that the bureau˚}˚}˚}s claims against both it and Mr. Danaher ˚}˚}˚}are meritless and in no way reflect the consumer-first approach we take to managing all our businesses.˚}˚}˚} Mr. Danaher who for many years led TransUnion Interactive, the company˚}˚}˚}s consumer sales subsidiary, moved into an ˚}˚}˚}advisory role˚}˚}˚} last April in preparation for his planned retirement in February, the company said in a regulatory report filed last year. Mr. Danaher˚}˚}˚}s lawyers, Jeff Knox and Brooke Cucinella of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, said in a written statement: ˚}˚}˚}These claims are without merit, and this lawsuit demonstrates that the C.F.P.B. is focused more on politically expedient headlines than the facts or the law. Mr. Danaher very much looks forward to his day in court.˚}˚}˚} Mr. Chopra, who has called for harsher punishments for firms that repeatedly violated consumer protection laws, said the bureau had taken the rare step of charging a company official personally because Mr. Danaher˚}˚}˚}s actions were ˚}˚}˚}egregious.˚}˚}˚} Mr. Danaher ˚}˚}˚}knew that following the law would reduce corporate revenue˚}˚}˚} and ˚}˚}˚}concocted a plan to dodge it and work around it,˚}˚}˚} Mr. Chopra said. The bureau is asking the court for financial restitution for consumers from the defendants, other penalty payments and an order barring the company from violating federal consumer protection laws. TransUnion is one of the three major credit bureaus, along with Equifax and Experian. They make most of their money selling credit reports to merchants and lenders but also sell credit monitoring products directly to consumers. On its website, TransUnion advertises that it has ˚}˚}˚}200 million files profiling nearly every credit-active consumer in the United States.˚}˚}˚} In the 2017 case, TransUnion paid nearly $14 million to consumers and a $3 million civil penalty to resolve claims that it had lured consumers into recurring payments and made false statements about the credit scores it sold to consumers. Without admitting to any past wrongdoing, TransUnion also agreed to five years of heightened monitoring by the bureau to confirm its compliance with federal consumer laws. The consumer bureau said in its latest suit that it had told TransUnion multiple times, starting in 2019 and continuing through 2021, that the company had violated the 2017 order. But the company didn˚}˚}˚}t alter its behavior, Mr. Chopra said at a news conference. ˚}˚}˚}TransUnion˚}˚}˚}s leadership is either unwilling or incapable of operating its businesses lawfully,˚}˚}˚} Mr. Chopra said. The bureau said in its complaint that Mr. Danaher had taken a number of steps to skirt the order. That included halting the rollout of an affirmative ˚}˚}˚}opt-in˚}˚}˚} checkbox intended to stop unintended subscription enrollments. ˚}˚}˚}I do not take the decision to charge individuals lightly, but based on the evidence uncovered in the investigation, I believe it was appropriate,˚}˚}˚} Mr. Chopra said. He added that if the bureau˚}˚}˚}s investigation uncovered other evidence of wrongdoing by senior leaders, the bureau would amend its complaint to personally charge them as well. TransUnion said in its prepared statement that it had attempted to abide by the terms of the agreement but was met with silence when it sought guidance from the bureau. ˚}˚}˚}Despite TransUnion˚}˚}˚}s months-long, good faith efforts to resolve this matter, C.F.P.B.˚}˚}˚}s current leadership refused to meet with us,˚}˚}˚} the company said. It added that the bureau˚}˚}˚}s ˚}˚}˚}unrealistic and unworkable demands have left us with no alternative but to defend ourselves fully.˚}˚}˚} TransUnion disclosed in a regulatory filing in February that it was in discussions with the consumer bureau about its compliance with the 2017 consent order, and expected the agency to sue if the company did not settle the case. TransUnion set aside $27 million and said it foresaw a ˚}˚}˚}reasonable possibility˚}˚}˚} of further expenses. Mr. Chopra, who worked on the consumer bureau˚}˚}˚}s creation in 2010 and 2011 and rejoined the agency last year as its director, is known as an aggressive regulator and has openly spoken of his frustration with how some companies break the law again and again. He wants regulators to go beyond fines and impose penalties ˚}˚}˚} like license revocations or growth caps ˚}˚}˚} that truly hurt, he has said. ˚}˚}˚}We must forcefully address repeat lawbreakers to alter company behavior and ensure companies realize it is cheaper, and better for their bottom line, to obey the law than to break it,ÅE}ÅE}ÅE} Mr. Chopra said in a speech last month. Ed Mills, a policy analyst at Raymond James, a financial services firm, said the suit was a warning shot to the financial industry ÅE}ÅE}ÅE} and a reversal from the agencyÅE}ÅE}ÅE}s meekness during the Trump administration.

There are now more than a million virtual cats available across various blockchains. And not just cats: There are digital dogs, cyber bunnies, crypto alpacas, frogs and robots, many of which are now abandoned remnants of one of the fastest technology boom-and-bust bubbles the world has seen.

But with crypto prices sliding rapidly, the company is now latching on to a new tech trend: Privacy. The main draw of Exodus, set for launch in December, is that it can be used as a cryptocurrency wallet and as a system that keeps digital keys to access these virtual assets in a safer place. They˚}˚}˚}re stored offline in the phone instead of being uploaded on the cloud or scribbled down on a piece of paper. (In keeping with the Biblical tone, Exodus˚}˚}˚} key management platform is called Zion.) Phil Chen, the Decentralized Chief Officer (decentralized seems to be the magic word) at HTC, told the South China Morning Post in July that the phone can also be used to connect to certain blockchain networks that help users trade tokens. Chen also implied that the phone will be used for mining tokens tied to the Exodus blockchain, noting that there is no timeline for when this will be launched. But a lot has happened since then. The crypto speculation craze has been subsiding even quicker than it rose during its peak in 2017. Bitcoin, the most popular virtual currency, has dropped from its peak of almost US$20,000 to today˚}˚}˚}s US4,400 per coin. However, there is one intriguing possible use of a blockchain phone -- and it˚}˚}˚}s not related to cryptocurrency speculators. According to Chen, it could give users more control over the data they share. ItÅEEøΩÅEEøΩÅEEøΩs a hot topic, especially as people become more suspicious of how online giants are handling our data. ÅEEøΩÅEEøΩÅEEøΩThe phone is the most accessible device,ÅEEøΩÅEEøΩÅEEøΩ Chen said during a panel at TechCrunch Shenzhen on Monday.

In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published an ingenious paper sketching the idea and architecture to implement a peer-to-peer digital cash system called Bitcoin. The system was launched in 2009 and, since then, has kick-started a wave of digital innovations related to blockchain. The meaning of blockchain is literal ˚}˚}˚} it refers to a way of storing data in a ˚}˚}˚}chain˚}˚}˚} of blocks. These data blocks are connected in a sequential ˚}˚}˚}chain˚}˚}˚} structure using their cryptographic summary called hashes (see Nakamoto 2008; figure reproduced below). A hash value is a numeric summary of a fixed length that is uniquely associated with the data used to produce it. It is computed by applying a mathematical hash function to the data. Because the hashes are highly sensitive to the stored data and no one can deterministically create a specific hash value, chaining them together creates dependency among the data and thus enhances their integrity. However, we must ensure that no one can (maliciously) change the data and re-generate all hashes to fool other users. This is accomplished by replicating the entire blockchain across a network of validators, who are responsible for verifying existing blocks and creating new blocks to store future data. Such replication and collaborative processing of the blockchain prevents anyone from unilaterally changing the data without being detected by others. Because of this feature, a blockchain is often called distributed ledger technology (DLT). The ability to guarantee data integrity in a distributed collaborative environment without the need for a trusted central administrator is appealing. Take property transactions as an example. In Hong Kong, all property transactions are handled by solicitors who check that all title and mortgage deeds are complete, and funds are available. Imagine if we now record all property transaction information into a blockchain that is jointly maintained by a large network of independent validators. We can track the history of the ownership and deed information of a property by directly reading the data from the blockchain without worrying about errors or frauds. This helps save the solicitor time and costs. Because of its power to facilitate trustworthy transactions without a trusted central party, blockchain has been tipped to be the next generation of the Internet. To many enthusiasts, it is not a matter of whether we should use blockchain, but when. In fact, many companies and even governments in some countries are planning to migrate their services to blockchain. Before we embark on the blockchain journey, however, we must remember that blockchain does carry some unique characteristics. Its data are trustable because multiple parties work together to verify and maintain the blockchain. Hence, it does not make sense if the entire blockchain is maintained by a single entity or organization, because it can then change any data within the blockchain without detection. Trust in Blockchain In fact, the value of blockchain lies heavily in whether trust is endowed in the service provider. The pioneering permissionless (aka public) blockchain, Bitcoin, assumes that no trust is placed in any single entity. Hence, it can be used as a completely decentralized digital cash system for peer-to-peer payments. Similarly, Ethereum, another popular public blockchain, facilitates tamper-proof execution of smart contracts in a truly decentralized environment. However, most people have no problem in trusting the financial institutions issuing our money or credit cards, or service providers handling our commercial transactions. To many people, having a central administrator is preferred because of the extra values it provides. For example, a bank guarantees that our money will not be stolen if we lose our credit cards and we can still access our account even if we forget its number. In the case of Bitcoin, once your fund is transferred out of your wallet or you lose the access key to your wallet, your Bitcoin is gone, forever. Therefore, the value of blockchain depends on whether we trust other parties to handle our data and the degree of control and transaction speed desired. The following framework is helpful: In general, if we trust the organizations handling our data, a conventional database or enterprise system will suffice. We can extend the system to a distributed architecture with clearly defined roles and regulations if collaborative processing is necessary. For example, in most countries, government systems and services are trusted and often distributed, sometimes in collaboration with other statutory or private organizations, but nonetheless managed by a single authority. For these services, a blockchain may not add significant value. If, however, we do not have full trust in our trading partners (as in the property transaction example), a blockchain may be helpful. The disadvantage of using a permissionless blockchain is that we cannot control how the validators work. Permissionless blockchains also tend to be less efficient as it takes time to manage the block creation and confirmation process among a large number of un-coordinated validators. Currently, it takes around 10 minutes to confirm Bitcoin and 15 seconds to confirm Ethereum transactions. Such latency makes permissionless blockchains an undesirable choice for applications that require real-time, instantaneous confirmations. Hence, if control and efficiency are important, we may consider using a permissioned (aka private or consortium) blockchain, which delegates exclusive roles to selected participating parties in validating transactions and creating the blocks. It is more efficient because we can coordinate all processing related to the blockchain. The transactions are still tamper-proof and trustworthy because the blockchain is replicated across a consortium of members. In other words, the members collaborate to ensure that no one can unilaterally change the data. Use with permission The drawback of using a permissioned blockchain is development cost. It takes effort to develop a native blockchain that is secure against malicious attacks or programming errors especially when we want fast transaction throughput in a highly-distributed environment with massive replication of data. The cost of developing applications on public blockchains such as Ethereum is relatively lower because the blockchain itself is proven to be secure and functioning properly. Forming a consortium that shares a common goal and motivation is not trivial either. Even if we can line up the participating parties, how to incentivize them to validate transactions and maintain the blockchain in an ongoing basis remains an unsolved problem. In fact, the need for trust is not entirely removed in a permissioned blockchain ÅEEøΩEÅEEøΩÅEEøΩE we must have faith in the consort",Business,Related to Blockchain,"South China Morning Post, News, Opinion, China, Hong Kong, World, US, Asia, Business, Economy, Technology, Lifestyle, Sport",South China Morning Post

Even though forced labour or marriage has trapped an estimated 40 million people worldwide, according to the 2018 Global Slavery Index (GSI), the problem is also linked to hundreds of million more businesses and consumers. With brands wanting cheap labour and workers desperate to escape poverty, it was easy for recruitment agencies, acting as the middle man, to exploit the situation, said William Nee, China researcher for Amnesty International. ˚}˚}˚}One of the big challenges is when people are recruited, or lured to go and work somewhere, they are often given false promises or exploited by agencies wherever they are coming from,˚}˚}˚} he said. Low wages, little compliance to decent working conditions and the relentless drive to produce more as suppliers strive to meet demanding quotas can be commonplace in international supply chains. Employment contracts and records can easily be altered, lost, or different versions shown to brand clients. Last year, just 66,000 of the exploited 40 million people, or 0.2 per cent, were rescued, according to the 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report. Workers could be deceived into a situation where even before they get to the work site, they had chalked up debt, said Matt Friedman, founder and CEO of Hong Kong-based non-profit The Mekong Club, the latest organisation to adopt the blockchain technology. ˚}˚}˚}A lot of the reason for that is along the way they are cheated and don˚}˚}˚}t even realise, because there is no transparency,ÅE}ÅE}ÅE} he said.

A decade ago, this scenario would have sounded crazy to a lot of people, but there are plenty of tech companies keen to make it happen. The art market is famously resistant to change, but even established art businesses are feeling the force of new technologies. High rents in art market centres are one reason, as mid-range galleries are increasingly interested in selling online. There is also the need to cater to the next generation of collectors, many of whom are more comfortable browsing a desired collectible on their smartphone rather than walking in to a gallery. In its 2017 report, art insurer Hiscox said the online art market grew by 15 per cent to US$3.75 billion in 2016. Investment in art industry start-ups reached US$505 million in 2015, a 300 per cent jump in two years, says Deloitte˚}˚}˚}s 2016 art market report. It is not just new players doing business online. Christie˚}˚}˚}s recorded an 86 per cent growth in online art sales in 2016. Photography and prints do well online, while expensive, one-off art pieces are still being auctioned off live. ˚}˚}˚}We want to ensure that our online sales are well curated, as opposed to being a dumping ground of unwanted stock,˚}˚}˚} said Ben Clark, deputy chairman of Christie˚}˚}˚}s Asia. ˚}˚}˚}We always see online auctions as a supplement to, not replacement of, our live auctions.˚}˚}˚} Brian Shipman, chief information officer at Heritage Auctions, has a similar view. Heritage Auctions recorded US$438.3 million in online sales in 2017, a 26 per cent increase from 2016. It was also the first time that more than half of Heritage˚}˚}˚}s sales volume was online. ˚}˚}˚}The online experience places so much information at your fingertips that you inherently want to go online for the transparency,˚}˚}˚} said Shipman. Aside from their own websites, traditional auction houses such as ChristieÅE}ÅE}ÅE}s, SothebyÅE}ÅE}ÅE}s and Heritage also rely on aggregator sites, which combine everything from art education to recruiting new collectors. Photography and prints do well online, while expensive, one-off art pieces are still being auctioned live. Photo: SCMP One such site is Artsy.

By applying the decentralised ledger technology to various parts of their back office, these companies have dramatically boosted their clientele while cutting back-office manpower. The use of blockchain also protects investors as it preserves incorruptible transaction records. And, in this process, they might also be disrupting the role traditionally played by banks in extending finance. Although banks are also exploring ways of incorporating blockchain into their operations, it is fintech companies, which are more agile and flexible in their organisational structure, that are embracing innovation faster than their banking counterparts. Financial inclusion ˚}˚}˚} extending credit to underserved segments that have limited access to bank services ˚}˚}˚} is also being advanced further through blockchain.

Chong Sing Holdings Fintech Group, a Hong Kong-listed company that provides loans to small and medium enterprises and retail borrowers in China, has registered more than four billion transaction records using blockchain platforms developed in-house over the past six months.

It is time to wrap your brain around what it is so you understand the impact on your business. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology that enables data to be confidently shared between a network of participants. The confidence stems from the ability to mathematically prove that the data hasn˚}˚}˚}t been tampered with, that access is controlled, and the assurance that everyone is accessing the same view of the data. If you˚}˚}˚}re thinking: ˚}˚}˚}Why the silly name?˚}˚}˚} And ˚}˚}˚}I˚}˚}˚}m still not sure I get what it is.˚}˚}˚} You are not alone. But keep reading. The name derives from the fact that it stores data in ˚}˚}˚}blocks˚}˚}˚} that are linked together cryptographically and chronologically into a ˚}˚}˚}chain˚}˚}˚} made of complex mathematical algorithms. (So now the name should make more sense). Blockchain technology can make a world of difference for Hong Kong companies Data is presented to a network of validators who work to achieve a consensus via a number of different possible mechanisms. Once the data is validated and consensus is achieved, the next block is created and updated across the network of nodes. Once created, the ledger cannot be altered, and it is updated for everyone in the network at the same time. ThatÅE}ÅE}ÅE}s what makes it consistent, durable and secure with controlled access such that each packet of data is only accessible by those with the appropriate access keys.

These activities seek to resolve problems of trust, fraud, and error. Substantial amounts of capital and collateral are also locked within the entire financial system. They act as a buffer against the failure of trust and confidence in undesirable outcomes.

The Seychelles-based company, which has raised US$3.17 million in pre-initial token sales as of this week, is issuing 1 billion tokens known as Bunny, aiming for them to be used as the de facto currency for the entire porn industry, according to a white paper outlining the scope of the coin offering (ICO). Explainer: What is an ICO, and why is China˚}˚}˚}s central bank banning it? The month-long public sale starting on April 25 will involve 70 per cent of the tokens, according to the offerer. Each Bunny is equivalent to US$1.43, or 0.000100 ethereum, with the price increasing by 1 per cent every day from March 13, rising to 0.000207 ethereum by May 25 at the end of the sale. Unsold tokens will be burnt, Bunny said. Bunny is the latest among thousands of companies piling into the vast unregulated market of cryptocurrencies, getting ahead of financial regulators and central banks to raise capital from investors who˚}˚}˚}re eager to chase after the next bitcoin. There are 1,500 different types of cryptocurrencies in circulation with a combined valuation estimated at US$600 billion, of which bitcoin - first released in 2009 - is the best known and most heavily traded. Cryptocurrencies, created through the use of blockchain technology, have a mixed reception in Asia. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are accepted as tokens of exchange in Japan and Hong Kong, while China has banned banks from dealing with any form of digital currency. Bunny, co-founded by Russian porn entrepreneur Alexander Maslov, is seeking to build an alternative payment ecosystem that skirts around conventional banks, where he claims that companies, actors or photographers employed in the adult entertainment industry are often barred from opening bank accounts, or face higher-than-usual costs to maintain their accounts.

The biggest US bank said it has developed a prototype digital coin that it plans to use to speed up payments between corporate customers, according to a statement released on Thursday. The token, dubbed JPM Coin, is based on blockchain technology, a decentralised public ledger of transactions that offers more speed because it does not rely on a central record keeper. ˚}˚}˚}Many of our clients move money in different ways and they˚}˚}˚}re looking for a more real-time way to move value around,˚}˚}˚} Umar Farooq, head of digital treasury services and blockchain, said in an interview. Hong Kong regulators say IPOs by cryptocurrency businesses are premature, putting Bitmain˚}˚}˚}s US$3 billion fundraising plan in peril JPMorgan moves more than US$5 trillion in wholesale payments each day, so even a nascent experiment from the banking giant is poised to make waves in the cryptocurrency world. While some experts questioned the broader impact of a dollar-pegged coin available only to JPMorgan clients, others said the bank˚}˚}˚}s involvement lends legitimacy to an area that is been rocked by volatility and scandal. The bank started developing JPM Coin about a year ago in response to client demand and plans to start testing out possible uses with a small number of its institutional customers in the coming months, Farooq said. He declined to name the interested companies. SWIFT, effectively an air-traffic control system for sending money around the world, has been working on a plan to make overseas transfers more efficient though a campaign known as the global payments innovation initiative. But banks still sometimes run into trouble clearing cross-border payments in real time, Farooq said. JPM Coin could eliminate that problem by allowing instantaneous value transfer, he said.

So while it is in itself tamper-proof, none of this data integrity benefits cryptocurrency traders. Photo: Getty Images Business After six months of record losses, can cryptocurrencies look forward to a hack-proof future? The case for closer regulation of digital asset trading gains ground after losses of US$1.73 billion so far this year Digital currencies + FOLLOW Georgina Lee + FOLLOW Published: 10:00am, 22 Jul 2018 Why you can trust SCMP For the many cryptocurrency holders who care about security, the year 2018 is shaping up to be a nerve-racking one. The reported losses from cryptocurrency hacks and scams in the first half have already surpassed US$1.73 billion, or more than half of the total recorded losses since 2011, according to Crypto Aware, a community-focused advocacy initiative. Of these, 36 per cent represented losses from exchange hacking. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, and the exchanges are asset exchanges. All other exchanges that trade assets are regulated Terence Tsang, chief operating officer, Tidebit The biggest exchange hack so far also took place this year. In January, more than 500 million units of the NEM token, then valued at US$547 million, were stolen from Japanese crypto-exchange Coincheck, upstaging the US$480 million loss suffered in 2014 by users of Mt. Gox, at that point the world˚}˚}˚}s biggest crypto-exchange, when 800,000 bitcoin were stolen. The hack triggered a series of legal claims and the crypto-exchange˚}˚}˚}s insolvency. And even though Coincheck said in March it had refunded more than US$440 million to its customers using its own funds, the frequency at which exchanges are being hacked highlights an obvious question ˚}˚}˚} does the current centralised exchange model, initiated by Mt. Gox and subsequently used by others, represent a security threat to digital assets? Also, do alternative approaches, such as decentralised exchange platforms and crypto-custodian providers, represent safer ways to trade and hold digital assets, as many of them claim? Trading IOUs rather than cryptocurrencies Similar to traditional stock exchanges, a centralised crypto-exchange is run by an organisation that oversees its operations, maintenance and security, and grants users access to the trading platform for a fee. A centralised exchange connects buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies, or cryptocurrencies to fiat money transactions. And while blockchain is well known as the decentralised ledger technology that underpins various cryptocurrencies, ironically, today transactions involving these digital tokens on centralised exchanges often do not happen on blockchain. So, despite blockchain being an immutable, tamper-proof architecture for recording data and transactions, because cryptocurrencies are being traded ÅE}ÅE}ÅE}off chainÅE}ÅE}ÅE}, none of this data integrity benefits cryptocurrency traders. Speed and costs are two key constraints for blockchain. Ethereum, for example, can only process about 20 transactions per second. Together with the transaction costs required for using the ethereum blockchain, this has meant many centralised exchanges today are instead using internal databases to process and record transactions. ÅE}ÅE}ÅE}All the hacking that is happening on exchanges today, does not happen on blockchain. But because transaction records are updated on the exchangeÅE}ÅE}ÅE}s internal database, hackers can just move digital assets around by changing the names of whoever owns the asset,ÅE}ÅE}ÅE} said Lionello Lunesu, co-founder and chief technology officer at Enuma, a blockchain engineering company helping the Hong Kong-based OAX Foundation to build a decentralised exchange platform.

PwC China and Hong Kong forensic services partner Eric Young said the new service comes at a time when he has seen growing interest from Asian companies in the manufacturing, retail and technology sectors seeking to raise funds through initial coin offerings (ICO). Both Hong Kong and Singapore have become favoured jurisdictions for token issuances, as both have opted not to regulate ICOs so long as the tokens are not structured as, or have no characteristics of, a security. Blockchain, also known as distributed ledger technology, is a digital, decentralised ledger that keeps records of all transactions that take place across a peer-to-peer network. It is also the underlying technology of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Young said the blockchain analytics tool, being developed by the emerging technology team comprising 80-plus people, will allow ICO issuers to trace their cryptocurrencies post-issuance ˚}˚}˚}While on the blockchain ledger one could track the amount of transactions that have been done using the cryptocurrencies, there is still no way for an issuer of an ICO to trace its coins and know how these coins are being used,˚}˚}˚} Young said. One goal is to help companies mange the risks of their tokens being transferred to entities or individuals linked to sanctioned countries. ˚}˚}˚}With artificial intelligence built into our back engine, our solutions would enable clients to better predict which jurisdictions the digital token could potentially be circulated to. Depending on the type of company and the type of business it is engaged in, it could then apply a high risk score to that particular jurisdiction,˚}˚}˚} he said.

The comment followed the exchange˚}˚}˚}s launch of a lending programme in Hong Kong last month, which allows users to store and earn interest on 60 cryptocurrencies and stable coins. Gemini˚}˚}˚}s platform promises an annualised return of up to 8.05 per cent in exchange for lending these tokens out to various borrowers, who back up the loans with collateral. As blockchain enables its users to borrow and lend funds with each other without the need for traditional players such as banks or brokers, existing rules governing these parties will not work for DeFi, according to Andy Meehan, chief compliance officer for Asia-Pacific at Gemini.

Paid Post:Cyberport Venture Capital Forum CVCF 2023 explores new tech & more + FOLLOW Advertising partner Published: 11:00am, 27 Oct 2023 Why you can trust SCMP In Mainland China, there are unmistakable signs of a revival in funds available for investors to allocate to expanding companies, marking the country as a fundraising exception in 2023 thus far. Contrary to the global downward trend, China has seen a surge in venture capital fundraising. In the first half of 2023 alone, it totalled US$43.4 billion, compared to US$46.9 billion for the entirety of 2022. The sectors of alternative energy, energy technology, and battery storage persist as attractive areas for VC investment in the region. Technologies and innovations are the primary attractions in most markets. In China, robust investment in AI, including generative AI, fuels significant startup growth, especially in critical industries. This growth is largely due to favourable government policies. The strong involvement of the government instils confidence in venture capital investors. However, the scenario is different in other regions. Investment in startups in India and Southeast Asia has been lacklustre. Indian startups raised only US$6.58 billion in the first half of 2023, which is approximately half of the funds raised in the first quarter of 2022 alone. This figure represents a year-on-year drop of 66 percent. In Q2 of 2023, Indonesian startups amassed a total of US$327 million in equity funding. Vietnamese startups, meanwhile, garnered US$413 million in total proceeds. However, these figures were outpaced by Singaporean startups, which secured US$1.24 billion within the same three-month period. If the current trend continues, the total funds raised in 2023 are projected to fall short of the previous yearÅE}ÅE}ÅE}s levels in these regions. Despite market volatility, a growing number of startup funders and founders are discovering opportunities in cutting-edge technologies and innovations.

This has been a cornerstone of the government under Xi, who has called for more development of pivotal technologies such as artificial intelligence, 5G and blockchain, and for more spending on basic research and improving capabilities in making home-grown chips. In a meeting earlier last month, Xi urged Chinese researchers to be more aggressive in terms of innovation. ˚}˚}˚}We need to focus on research and development of key technologies with first-mover advantages and basic cutting-edge technologies that lead future development,˚}˚}˚} the meeting concluded. 01:36 AI chip maker ordered by US government to halt exports to China AI chip maker ordered by US government to halt exports to China Trying to leapfrog the market by developing frontier technologies was always a tall order. In the face of US sanctions and a slowing economy, though, that hard work has only got harder. On paper, there have been some impressive gains. Baidu launched a quantum computer that consumers could access via a smartphone app. Construction is underway on the largest pulsed-power plant in the world, leading one engineer to predict that China could achieve nuclear fusion energy by 2028. China is even funding civilian hypersonic transport. Yet, in terms of practical technological advances in the economy today, the gains have been more modest. This is most obvious in the case of semiconductors. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) gained attention in July when researchers said China˚}˚}˚}s largest chip manufacturer achieved the ability to make 7-nanometre chips. Yet, it is barred by US sanctions from buying the most cutting-edge equipment that is used to make these types of chips, so it was likely using older technology, and there is no sign that it is able to produce them at scale. There are signs that Beijing is growing impatient with the pace of development in the semiconductor industry. In August, it opened corruption probes against six executives at the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, the country˚}˚}˚}s biggest chip fund. China˚}˚}˚}s continued dependence on overseas technology has become more conspicuous in recent months. The China Semiconductor Industry Association has complained of a ˚}˚}˚}hostile˚}˚}˚} environment created by the US Chips and Science Act, which is meant to pump nearly US$53 billion into the American semiconductor industry for more domestic production. Pouring salt on the wound is a provision that prohibits beneficiaries of the new law from building advanced factories in China for 10 years. The fight over chips also has knock-on effects in other industries considered strategically important. This was most recently seen with artificial intelligence (AI), which has come to heavily rely on advanced graphics processing units from Nvidia for machine learning. 01:57 Biden signs US$280 billion act to boost high-tech manufacturing and research Biden signs US$280 billion act to boost high-tech manufacturing and research When the US barred Nvidia from selling its powerful A100 and H100 chips to China, the domestic AI industry reeled. As one industry insider pointed out, Nvidia chips are hard to replace when it comes to AI. In August, chip exports from China plummeted by nearly a quarter, the biggest monthly drop since records began in 1997. Left to their own devices, companies would prefer to keep selling into China without limits. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he remains confident in the China market despite the new sanctions. ASML, the Dutch firm with a global monopoly on the extreme ultraviolet lithography machines that SMIC is barred from buying, also said it plans to further expand in China.

We are part of the Trust Project What is it? Like Facebook, K-pop-focused entertainment companies based in South Korea are jumping on popular digital trends. These include creating their own metaverses and crafting virtual stars. At the heart of many of these initiatives is the rise of cryptocurrencies and non fungible-tokens (NFTs). Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Dogecoin have been popularised as an alternative to traditional monetary formats, providing lucrative opportunities for tech-savvy investors. With the rise of NFTs this year, especially in the entertainment and art fields, as a way to sell transferable, blockchain-based digital records of ownership for pieces of digital artwork, it was only a matter of time before K-pop bought into the trend. Following rumours of companies such as BTS˚}˚}˚} management Hybe Corp launching NFTs, and Hybe denouncing efforts to persuade the group˚}˚}˚}s fans to invest in cryptocurrency using the band˚}˚}˚}s brand without permission, November has seen major K-pop labels announce plans to embrace these very technologies. On November 4, Hybe said it was partnering with the largest cryptocurrency operator in South Korea, Dunamu, which hosts the popular cryptocurrency exchange Upbit, to launch a joint venture focused on creating and marketing NFTs tied to Hybe˚}˚}˚}s roster of artists. These include not only K-pop stars such as BTS but also Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande and many others. Aespa with their virtual counterparts. The same day, Korean media reported that YG Entertainment, the label of superstar K-pop girl group Blackpink, was investing in a soon-to-launch NFT business venture funded by several entertainment and business entities. And on November 9, SM Entertainment, the label of K-pop groups including NCT and Aespa, announced it would create content, tied into its SMCU metaverse, that would be sold via NFTs in collaboration with the prominent blockchain platform Solana. While these entertainment giants are the latest, and most prominent, adopters of NFTs in South Korea, other Korean music companies made similar announcements earlier this year. In July, JYP Entertainment, the label of K-pop groups Twice and Stray Kids, also said it would be working with Dunamu, and smaller entertainment companies announced digital technology ventures around the same time.

From verifying the authenticity and provenance of works, to spurring new forms of digital art through non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain technology is having a huge impact on the art scene. Put simply, blockchain is a secure and transparent electronic ledger that is digitally distributed, decentralised, open source and public. Each block in a chain contains three things: the data, the hash (a unique set of numbers and letters created by an algorithm) of the block, and the hash of the previous block in the chain.

People˚}˚}˚}s Daily, the party˚}˚}˚}s mouthpiece, ran an editorial on its website days after Xi˚}˚}˚}s speech, saying ˚}˚}˚}officials and party cadres must understand that the top leadership attaches high importance to blockchain technology due to the prospects of its application in the real economy, people˚}˚}˚}s livelihood and the state governance˚}˚}˚}.

Social enterprises and NGOs have also been springing up, each with different ways and new ideas to encourage and help the general public and businesses to reduce their plastic footprint. It is with this in mind that a recent study has sought to take a closer look at some of the recently emerged innovative business models, including those which use cutting-edge blockchain and mobile technologies to connect and streamline the different participants in a plastic recycling supply chain, that are aimed at preventing plastic from entering the world˚}˚}˚}s oceans. The team, including top researchers at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) Business School, found that the ability of such businesses to generate a healthy profit and make a positive environmental and social impact often depends on their product mix. Even more importantly, the study found that a company which aims at both maximising its profits and the amount of recycled plastic it deals with can actually generate a large social and environmental impact with just a slight sacrifice on its profitability, when compared to a solely profit-seeking firm. According to UN Environment Programme, only about 9 percent of all waste plastic produced has been recycled. The rest of it ends up in landfills, enters our waterways and finds its way to the ocean. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a collection of marine debris in the North Pacific Ocean, has an area of 1.6 million square kilometres and is roughly three times the size of France. Once entering the ocean, the waste plastic gradually degrades into smaller and smaller pieces and becomes Microplastics, which are plastics of less than five millimetres in diameter. These can get eaten by marine animals and endanger their lives. A Plethora of Innovative Business Models Responding to this environmental threat, some eco-friendly companies, such as Blue Avocado (a company that makes reusable grocery bags) and Litre of Light (a company that turns recycled plastic bottles into lights), are trying to replace plastic products with other more sustainable ones or turn used plastic into other products. Others are taking a decidedly different route ˚}˚}˚} Plastic Bank and RePurpose Global are companies that seek to provide monetary incentives for people and businesses to stop plastic pollution and increase recycled volumes. Headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, Plastic Bank develops and operates a mobile app that uses blockchain technology to connect collectors and processors as well as track the provenance of recycled plastic to make sure it is ethically sourced. It currently operates in five developing countries ˚}˚}˚} Brazil, Haiti, Indonesia, the Philippines and Egypt. It bills itself as a ˚}˚}˚}bank˚}˚}˚} because the company turns recycled plastic into a currency that those who collect plastic can use in exchange for money, food, water and even school tuition for their children. RePurpose Global is a plastic credit platform that enables individuals and businesses to become plastic neutral by funding plastic recycling. The study ˚}˚}˚}Innovative Business Models in Ocean-Bound Plastic Recycling˚}˚}˚} was written by Sean Zhou, Professor and Chairperson in the Department of Decision Sciences and Managerial Economics and PhD student Zhuoluo Zhang at CUHK Business School in collaboration with Prof. Opher Baron and Prof. Gonzalo Romero at the University of Toronto. In this paper, the researchers looked at the innovative business models adopted by companies like Plastic Bank in the plastic recycling industry of developing countries. ˚}˚}˚}For budding social entrepreneurs in this business, they typically must strike a balance between contributing to improving the environment, making sure there˚}˚}˚}s a fair and equitable distribution of wealth within the recycling supply chain, and to at least avoid turning a loss,˚}˚}˚} says Prof. Zhou. ˚}˚}˚}We find with a bit of ingenuity and some tinkering with the business model, it is actually possible to fill the three needs, that of environmental, social and financial, with one deed.˚}˚}˚} An Ecosystem Plastic recycling is hardly a new business. Traditionally, scavengers collect plastic bottles or boxes and sell them to shops that process the materials. The companies studied in the research seek to break up this old pattern by introducing blockchain and creating an ecosystem for this environmentally-beneficial activity. The new model goes something like this: A company connects scavengers and plastic waste processing shops with a mobile app, which registers the amount of plastic collected and processed and other related information via mobile app. At the same time, it also provides subsidies to both the scavengers and plastic waste processers to encourage them to use the app (so that the source of recycled plastic can be traced) and collect and process as much plastic as possible. Or if thereÅE}ÅE}ÅE}s no existing recycled plastic supply chain in the region, the company would help to activate and build up one,",News,Related to Blockchain,"South China Morning Post, News, Opinion, China, Hong Kong, World, US, Asia, Business, Economy, Technology, Lifestyle, Sport",South China Morning Post

On the surface, the whole concept reeks of a bubble: investors paying millions for works that can often be viewed and shared online for free. Many speculative collectors see NFTs as an alternative investment instrument, no different from any other financial product. There is a case to be made for NFTs, however. Due in part to the pervasiveness of internet piracy, many digital creations grab the attention of the younger generation, but generate low returns compared to traditional art. With tamper-resistant ownership made possible by the NFT technology, digital art can now be sold for real value. In cases of inflated value, investors are paying not just for artists˚}˚}˚} labour, but also for bragging rights as owners of one-of-a-kind pixels.

The cryptocurrency industry has been, and continues to be, one of the most innovative developments of the 21st century. Amid the technological advancement of the industry, countries and their regulators need to speed up the development of frameworks that will allow the industry to flourish. Recent regulatory developments within Asia ˚}˚}˚} specifically in Hong Kong and Singapore ˚}˚}˚} coupled with developer talent and an appetite for investment have positioned the region as a global hub for blockchain. The United States has historically been the global leader in innovation. The country˚}˚}˚}s innovation ecosystem was unrivalled globally, but blockchain technology has bucked this trend. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sent an official warning to Coinbase, alleging violations of federal securities laws over the offering of unregistered securities. Days later, the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission filed a complaint against Binance, also over unregistered securities. Across the industry, there is a need for clarity around cryptocurrency regulation. This is in large part because US government officials themselves seemingly cannot decide how the space should be regulated, leaving key players in a constant state of limbo. The shifting regulatory landscape around cryptocurrency has frustrated developers, who are unsure what to expect from regulators. A proposed bill in the US House of Representatives seeks to create a centralised record of all off-chain cryptocurrency transactions where regulators can access all activity. This legislation could threaten the foundation that cryptocurrency was built on. By sending these mixed and sometimes hostile signals, the US government is limiting the innovative ecosystem the Web3 space needs to survive. 03:09 US company plans to use bitcoin mining to clean up coal waste US company plans to use bitcoin mining to clean up coal waste Following the latest regulatory moves from US lawmakers and officials, some Web3 leaders, cryptocurrency companies and blockchain developers feel they have no choice but to establish operations elsewhere. As it stands, the US will miss out on being a leader in the blockchain space. While the US has intensified its regulatory focus on the cryptocurrency space, Asia and Europe have taken steps to establish their own frameworks. The European Union˚}˚}˚}s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) has been approved by the European regulatory body. However, there is a significant barrier preventing this framework from going into effect in the immediate future. MiCA will apply across 27 European countries, but before it is a fully active framework, the regulatory authorities and governments in each of these countries still have work to do. Therefore, the goal of the MiCA framework going into effect by mid-2024 could be out of reach. Until the framework is fully fleshed out, cryptocurrency and blockchain companies must continue to err on the side of caution when setting up a base of operations within any European country. Even with the addition of MiCA and Switzerland˚}˚}˚}s innovative leadership in Europe, it still feels as though Asia will be the pivotal region for cryptocurrency in the next bull cycle. More blockchain companies in progressive regulatory markets such as Switzerland are looking to set up in the East.

Such enforcement measures are nothing new. But what makes this case unique is that Tornado Cash is a piece of open-source software. Essentially an automated tool, Tornado Cash mixes digital assets and redistributes them to preserve privacy. While we don˚}˚}˚}t know everything about Tornado Cash or why it was created, we do know that large sums of digital assets linked to illicit activity have moved through the protocol since it was launched, including millions stolen by North Korean hackers. Any American who uses the service now faces up to 20 years in prison. Some believe that such sanctions are necessary to prevent money laundering, while others see them as a sign of government overreach. But whatever one˚}˚}˚}s perspective, it˚}˚}˚}s worth asking why there was a need for a protocol like Tornado Cash in the first place. The short answer is that our financial system is failing to balance privacy and security. Fortunately, this is a challenge that Web3 (blockchain) technologies could help to resolve.

More than a billion people worldwide ˚}˚}˚} including millions in the US ˚}˚}˚} lack access to basic financial services. Many cannot pay their bills or send money to family because they don˚}˚}˚}t have a bank account or identification, and others simply don˚}˚}˚}t trust financial institutions. These suspicions are often legitimate. Carrying out transactions of any size requires us to share sensitive information like birth dates, addresses and social security numbers. Regardless of whether you˚}˚}˚}re renting a flat or a car, that information is routinely abused and compromised. Identity thieves have reportedly been hijacking accounts at Experian ˚}˚}˚} one of the three major credit bureaus ˚}˚}˚} simply by signing up for new profiles using the victims˚}˚}˚} personal information. Another credit bureau, Equifax, exposed the data of 150 million people (or roughly the entire US workforce) in 2017. 07:30 Why China is tightening control over cybersecurity Why China is tightening control over cybersecurity The current system works just fine for criminals. A 2011 report by the United Nations found that 99.8 per cent of money laundering worldwide goes unpunished. But we can redesign our financial infrastructure to offer more privacy and security, without enabling dictators and fraud, by harnessing Web3 technologies to unlock new approaches to confidentiality and identity verification. In most of the world, digital privacy is effectively nonexistent. Either you live in a country like China, where the government knows everything about you and uses that information to manipulate your behaviour for political purposes, or you live in a place like the US, where Big Tech manipulates your behaviour for commercial purposes. Over the long term, neither arrangement is compatible with a healthy, open society. But Web3 could provide a third way, by allowing us more control of our digital identities and information, while adding a layer of accountability to help stop bad actors. To be sure, most Web3 protocols have operated at either extreme of the privacy continuum. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum provide full transparency into transactions through public records, while protocols like Tornado Cash attempt to achieve total anonymity by mixing assets from legitimate users alongside those belonging to criminals and rogue regimes.

A new blockchain-based infrastructure has the potential to transform the system. The urgency to channel more investment into green projects is particularly acute in Asia. Within Southeast Asia, the investment gap for sustainable infrastructure projects is estimated at US$200 billion annually until 2030.

Rural activity accounts for about half the income, with the rest coming from part-time work and remittances from urban family members. The biggest challenges that farmers face are land rights and access to loans. Ownership and use of land are highly regulated in the Chinese countryside. Rural residents cannot put up their land as collateral for loans, as they do not have property ownership certificates. Farmers cannot move up the value chain by using arable land for other purposes. For rural Chinese, the increased dependence on digital technology during the Covid-19 pandemic could prove to be a game-changer.

Global issuance of green bonds surged to US$362.06 billion in the first nine months of this year, with a record US$500 billion expected to be printed by the end of the year. Designed to fund projects that are positive for the environment, green bonds have gained popularity as companies view them as a way to be more sustainable and to also show that to the market. The instruments have been viewed favourably by governments, with the European Union selling green bonds under its pandemic recovery fund plan in October and China˚}˚}˚}s green bond market headed for its busiest year ever amid a national push for net-zero emissions.

However, that was before Covid-19 and my initial vision of how a vaccine passport could utilise blockchain technology was a mere pipe dream at a time when there was no need for it. That said, in recent months countries around the world have been forced to grapple with the challenges of a return to some semblance of normality. From negotiations between governments and pharmaceutical companies for vaccine contracts to a gradual loosening of border restrictions, success has varied from country to country, owing to disparate public health and pandemic mitigation strategies. More than 4 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide. Even so, inequalities in vaccine distribution raise the question as to whether we stand a chance at truly returning to the way things were before. Some governments have opted to implement novel technologies such as blockchain to support their contact tracing and keeping immunisation records.

To date, a patchwork of solutions has emerged in a bid for governments to best control cross-border movement. Initiatives such as the International Air Travel Association˚}˚}˚}s Travel Pass ˚}˚}˚} which enables passengers to ensure they match the testing and vaccination requirements at their destination ˚}˚}˚} to the European Union˚}˚}˚}s Digital Covid Certificate point to an array of solutions, but these are ultimately short-sighted. There is now a need for an accreditation framework determined by its interoperability across different systems and jurisdictions. As Covid-19 continues to evolve, increasingly aggressive variants emerging in new communities show the globalised reality we live in, and the solutions we employ must reflect this fact. The distributed ledger underpinning blockchain can counter the current siloed environment of vaccine passports. By storing data in a distributed, decentralised way, governments no longer need to maintain databases on a national level. Borderless and interoperable by design, the technology can help establish an efficient system to reconcile user data against local measures in an automated manner. Smart contracts, pre-encoded with specific terms and guidelines, can be used to process vaccination records, ensuring requirements are met in terms of vaccination type or how long since a person was first vaccinated.

Ensuring proper cybersecurity measures must remain a priority for private and public companies, especially given the increasingly online and digital nature of operating systems today. Currently, many industrial control systems are run by supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, which are a mixture of software and hardware components that enable the control of facilities like production plants. Companies typically use industrial control systems, and by extension SCADA systems, to gather real-time data on all aspects of industrial production, ranging from the refining of oil to the control of waste disposal and even coordinating the transportation of goods. The critical oversight role that SCADA systems play within the industrial control system framework makes SCADA systems particularly appealing to threat actors, with Stuxnet being the first known to exclusively target SCADA systems to control networks. Gasoline tankers pass by the Colonial Pipeline storage tanks located in Austell, Georgia, on May 10, as they enter the Marathon Powder Springs Terminal. Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution/TNS Could implementing a blockchain framework help prevent such cyberattacks on industrial control and SCADA systems? The answer is a resounding yes, particularly if blockchain implementation is also merged with other emerging technologies like internet-of-things devices and 5G. SCADA systems currently have several key components needed for a system to function, such as the SCADA display unit, remote terminal units, a control unit, and some sort of communication link to tie the network together. The SCADA display unit allows for the monitoring of the entire industrial control system, while remote terminal units help to monitor the specific process being managed. The control unit passes data between the display unit and remote terminal units, with communication links being primarily industry-dependent, including Ethernet, internet-based wide-area network (WAN) links, and even radio waves. SCADA systems are primarily made secure through local area network (LAN) and WAN devices. These tools allow for increased monitoring of SCADA processes. However, by virtue of the increasing popularity of internet protocol (IP)-based systems, SCADA systems also inherit the same vulnerabilities, among many others. SCADA systems can be breached in a variety of ways ˚}˚}˚} through denial-of-service attacks, spoofing attacks, or even through spam emails. People work at a production line of the JBS-Friboi chicken processing plant in Lapa, Parana State, Brazil, in March 2017.

Photo: AFP This makes protecting SCADA systems especially important for public and private organisations alike, with these systems often being the key to monitoring and protecting critical infrastructure throughout the world. Blockchain could provide increased security for SCADA systems by acting as an instrument of authentication, authorisation and non-repudiation of critical data. Two specific cases that blockchain could be used in are as a secure protocol between SCADA display units and remote terminal units, and as a verification tool to validate system firmware and software.

The country˚}˚}˚}s asset management sector is one of the world˚}˚}˚}s largest, crossing the 100 trillion yuan (US$14.3 trillion) mark last year, with Chinese venture capital firms putting over 1.2 trillion yuan into tech start-ups. According to a 2017 Deloitte and China Venture joint report, almost 40 per cent of the world˚}˚}˚}s 252 ˚}˚}˚}unicorns˚}˚}˚} (tech start-ups valued at US$1 billion or more) are based in China. The hottest hi-tech trend since the advent of the internet is certainly blockchain. And Chinese entrepreneurs have been at the forefront of the ˚}˚}˚}blockchain revolution˚}˚}˚} since the beginning. It is no secret that the majority of the world˚}˚}˚}s cryptocurrency mining activity is based in China, with some estimates stating that it could be as high as 70 per cent. Sichuan is believed to be home to millions of small-time miners, and one report estimated that 70 per cent of all of China˚}˚}˚}s cryptocurrency mining is based in the province. Cryptocurrency mining is the process of validating cryptocurrency-based transactions and adding the transactions to the blockchain ledger. Miners get compensated for their services with cryptocurrencies. Typically, miners convert some of their cryptocurrency assets into fiat (government-backed currencies), and invest some in virtual currencies. A year ago, the Chinese government cracked down on ICOs. Initial coin offerings are the blockchain equivalent of IPOs, in which investors buy tokens in blockchain start-ups in exchange for cryptocurrency and fiat currencies. China effectively branded ICOs a pyramid scheme and banned them to protect its citizens from fraud. In fact, some observers in China believe that only about 1 per cent of ICOs were legitimate fundraising operations working to fund real businesses and not deploying some aspects of a pyramid scheme. Watch: Hong Kong bitcoin firm sees rise in trade after mainland ban on cryptocurrencies What˚}˚}˚}s an ICO, and why does China˚}˚}˚}s central bank ban it? This decision protected numerous Chinese investors lacking sophistication and experience, but also sent earthquake-level shocks through the cryptocurrency universe, eventually influencing the value of cryptocurrencies. The end of 2017 marked the end of the cryptocurrency bull market. The positive outcome of that major shift was the growing realisation that cryptocurrencies do not equal blockchain. There is life in blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies. Other ways of funding blockchain start-ups emerged. Private coin offerings, with deals moved mostly outside China, turned out to have numerous advantages over ICOs and professional investors started playing much more important roles in the deals. This development made a major difference in the market, turning it into a serious industry. This bodes well for the Chinese economy as it strives to become more transparent.

Bankless, cash-based societies are where the real money transfer market lies, with global remittance flows to developing countries reaching a record of US$466 billion in 2017. In recent years, blockchain technology emerged as the solution to enable a global money transfer system to operate without the need for banks. It is easy to forget that bitcoin was born only 10 years ago, or that it spurred an array of blockchains geared to make international money transfers cheaper. There was no alternative before this to send money internationally without banks, other than costly alternatives such as Western Union, MoneyGram and the like. To build a cheaper and practical bankless money transfer ecosystem requires the development of various intricate layers of transferring cash from one country to another, and connections to global currencies.

But some construction companies behind this opulent building in Qatar have been tainted by accusations of forced labour, with the Guardian estimating that more than 6,500 migrant construction workers died in the emirate amid World Cup preparations. To avoid backlash and boycotts, companies must conduct supply chain due diligence to stamp out forced labour. Forced labour is more pervasive in developing low-income countries because of inconsistent law enforcement. When high-income nations such as Qatar are accused of using forced labour, it comes as a surprise to some. But should it? Human trafficking is also prevalent in developed economies. The United States is no exception. Last year, US authorities uncovered a human trafficking ring that smuggled forced labour from Mexico and the rest of Central America to work in Georgia farms. In Hong Kong and Singapore, foreign domestic helpers have complained of being subjected to forced labour despite being documented workers with legal rights such as paid medical insurance and a rest day each week. To curb forced labour, there were talks in 2018 to propose a law in Hong Kong to require companies to report whether their supply chains are free from slavery, and give enforcement officers wider investigation powers. But the social unrest in 2019 followed by the Covid-19 pandemic have disrupted the progress. As Hong Kong reopens its doors to the world, it is time to resume its commitment to treat all workers in Hong Kong with kindness, empathy and humility. Regulations should never be a means to an end. But they can motivate firms to act. We suggest four ways for companies to conduct their supply chain due diligence effectively and practically. 02:53 Qatar World Cup Chief dismisses migrant worker abuse claims after death at tournament venue Qatar World Cup Chief dismisses migrant worker abuse claims after death at tournament venue First, target high-risk commodities and operations.

Non-fungible tokens as bonds are a new concept but could help establish central bank digital currencies, and offer cheaper and safer transactions It could also help central banks access alternative forms of financing and digitise traditional asset vehicles Hugh Harsono + FOLLOW Published: 2:30pm, 13 Jun 2021 Why you can trust SCMP Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have exploded in popularity over the last year or so, their adoption increasingly commonplace as more people take up digital currency. As unique digital tokens, NFTs are typically used for collectible items such as artwork or music, and exist as units of data on a blockchain with extra information stored in them. While copies can be made, the value of the NFT itself is due to its one-of-a-kind nature, and also set by the market and by demand. In contrast, traditional investment vehicles such as stocks and bonds are considered fungible, which means that every unit is essentially interchangeable. For example, one unit of ordinary stock in a company is the same as another, and is treated as such. However, bonds could be made non-fungible. Doing so would transform the traditional asset vehicle into one aligned with the latest digital currency initiatives being introduced by central banks all over the world. 05:15 SCMP Explains: What are NFTs?

TechInnovation  Schools are recording students' results using bitcoin tech Using shared database blockchain saves schools money and makes it easier for employers to check candidates' credentials CNBC + FOLLOW  CNBC + FOLLOW Published: 12:45pm, 10 May 2016 Why you can trust SCMP Recording and verifying candidates' credentials can be costly and time-consuming for academia and businesses alike. Now, some education facilities are turning to bitcoin technology for help. They are using blockchain, which was developed alongside the digital cryptocurrency bitcoin , to record their students' achievements in a cheap, secure and public way. Blockchain works like a decentralized ledger, storing information on a global network that is publicly available and should be safe from tampering. One example is Holberton School of software engineering in San Francisco, which was established as a project-based alternative to college. In October 2015, the school announced plans to share academic certificates on blockchain from 2017. For employers  it avoids having them to spend valuable time checking candidates' educational credentials by having to call universities or to pay a third party to do the job  it cannot go down and cannot be altered  according to Sylvain Kalache, co-founder at Holberton School. Using blockchain also means the school saves money from building and operating its own database. Because of the design of the blockchain-distributed database  making the data always available and secureÅEEøΩEÅEEøΩÅEEøΩthe blockchain does this free of charge  Kalache said. The University of Nicosia in Cyprus is also using the technology to record students' achievements and it is proving popular, according to George Papageorgiou, a digital currency lecturer at the university. We've only encountered enthusiasm in the practical uses so far and students are glad to be able to verify  with their new knowledge and the blockchain  he says. We believe this instills confidence in both students and potential employers that (they) can check on their own  he added. Ed Featherston, director at digital consultancy Collaborative""sulting, said he was working with several universities considering adopting blockchain technology. Apart from using it to cheaply track and record students' coursework, some""e considering providing micro-courses and micro-credentials, verified through the blockchain. We eliminate all of the overhead of the intermediary third-party systems to try""nd validate all of this [coursework]  he said. The cost of it from a systemic and transactional perspective becomes much lower and makes it a much more feasible concept to do.""

A research paper commissioned by global financial messaging service SWIFT was published Monday based on interviews and focus group meetings with individuals from 75 organizations working in technol  there is currently too much hype. ""Strong claims are now being made about the potential of mutual distributed ledgers to reduce costs and risks. A number of initiatives applying mutual distributed ledger to securities settlement are now being pursuedogy and post-trade processing.

A firm called R3 has brought together a group of the world's biggest banks including JPMorgan and Citigroup and is dedicated to researching and delivering new financial technology. Meanwhile  Digital Asset Holdings ÅEEøΩEÅEEøΩÅEEøΩE a firm run by former JPMorgan executive Blythe Masters ÅEEøΩEÅEEøΩÅEEøΩE is developing blockchain technology that can be used by the banks. Earlier this year  the company partnered with JPMorgan to explore the technology. Masters has said that various forms of blockchain technology will be ""mmercial setting in less than a couple of years""  highlighting the optimism in the industry about its uptake. And the authors of SWIFT's paper clearly see a benefit too  suggesting blockchain technology provides the industry ""with an opportunity to harmonise business processes and address many long-neglected inefficiencies in post-trade and other financial operations"". Still  SWIFT's paper dispelled a long-held myth about blockchain ÅEEøΩEÅEEøΩÅEEøΩE that it would get rid of third parties in trades. The idea is that two or more parties would be able to use blockchain technology to carry out a trade and this could all be done without the need for any other interference. But SWIFT said that a central third party role would still exist  albeit more narrowly  as a mean of confirming identity and existence of an asset  as well as dispute resolution and enforcing legal obligations. Challenges And financial institutions will need to overcome some challenges to welcome blockchain technology. One of those is opening up and sharing data in order for these databases to work according to the authors. For example  if four or five banks want to be involved in a trading transaction via a blockchain  they will need to be willing to share certain data that they may not have done in the past. Using blockchain technology would also mean a ""eering of business processes across multiple firms""  something that could be time-consuming and costly but ultimately beneficial in the long-term. Essentially  the adoption of blockchain in financial trading  will require an industry-wide effort.

The platform aims to help organisations verify the credibility of cross-order data based on the blockchain, and it is expected to run trials in cross-border finance between Shenzhen and Hong Kong as the first phase when it becomes operational, according to a report by the official Shenzhen Special Zone Daily on Wednesday.

With the explosion of digital art, music and literature, creatives have been empowered to share work on a level never before seen. As emerging technologies like blockchain-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) expand further into the digital asset space, artists and other creators need to understand when and how to use these tools to protect and boost their works. In a time when digital content is extremely easy to copy and distribute, creators must find a better way to harness the benefits of digital distribution. Relying on government laws on copyright will not be enough to ensure that value does not get lost along the way. Digital creativity, intellectual property and new technologies are rapidly changing how we interact with and consume media. Creating content digitally has enabled us to express ourselves in ways that have never before been possible. We now can easily create graphics, music, videos and text that can be shared across multiple platforms. This allows us to access a variety of creative works from around the world without having to physically visit the location where it was created. Beyond Beeple: what˚}˚}˚}s next in the world of NFT art? It should be no surprise that copyright laws were established only in the 18th century after access to the printing machine became reasonably accessible. Similarly, copyright laws for digital content, such as DMCA, were not approved until 1998, when 147 million users were already ˚}˚}˚}surfing the web˚}˚}˚}. Even so, more than US$225 billion is lost every year in the US alone due to intellectual property rights being violated, according to estimates by the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property. Nowadays, with over 5.2 billion people online, this shift in sharing content has also changed how we think about intellectual property rights. Even if they have been poorly enforced, laws have been created to better protect digital creations and help ensure fair compensation for creators of original works. It has become increasingly difficult for creators to protect their works as they spread across multiple platforms and devices. This is incredibly challenging when it comes to digital piracy, where it is often impossible to track down who downloaded or shared a particular piece of content. A lot has been said about the general role of NFTs for creators can be summarised in the following categories: Provenance: NFTs allow the creation of a digital record of ownership and origin for creative work. This can help establish authorship and prevent intellectual property theft. Immutability: NFTs are stored on a blockchain, which is an immutable ledger. This means that once an NFT is created, it cannot be altered, providing a tamper-proof record of ownership and authenticity for the creative work. Traceability: The use of blockchain technology in NFTs allows for traceability, which can be useful for creators to track the ownership and resales as well as better understand their customers. Monetisation: NFTs can be bought, sold, and traded on blockchain marketplaces. This allows creatives to monetise their work in new ways, such as through royalties, rentals, subscriptions and membership models. Accessibility: NFTs can be bought, sold and traded globally, which allows creators to connect with new audiences and expand their reach. A man looks at an NFT by artist Jen Stark at a festival called The Gateway: A Web3 Metropolis during Miami Art Week, November 30, 2022, in Miami. Photo: AP In addition, transactions involving digital assets can be executed almost instantly, reducing costs and friction. Because digital assets can be easily stored and transferred globally, they are accessible to many people, regardless of their location. The programmability of digital assets enables the development of self-executing smart contracts that automate procedures and eliminate the need for middlemen, reducing costs and facilitating the development of innovative use cases for decentralised finance and NFTs. Overall, digital assets are a better technology for creatives than anything we have had at our fingertips so far. Digital assets also offer extra value to the owners of the creator˚}˚}˚}s work. Digital assets offer an exciting solution during a time when scarcity can only be forced artificially. NFTs can be used to create new business models and incentivise consumers to get their content from legitimate distribution channels rather than going for pirated or unofficial ones. Companies can offer special rewards for purchasing a digital asset, such as access to exclusive content or limited-edition products. This is because digital assets can ˚}˚}˚}track˚}˚}˚} each real customer for the whole customer journey and deliver a personalised experience and extra rewards that cannot be done otherwise. Creators can reward their fans at any point of their journeys by setting specific criteria that are trackable on-chain or otherwise. NFTs offer access to unique experiences and can create a customised value proposition. In addition, digital assets create a common ground for partnerships and interconnectivity between IPs. The transparency of this technology makes it perfect for brands to collaborate with each other and scale the value proposition of their communities. Finally, it is important to note that while cryptocurrency and blockchain technology has the potential to provide a secure and efficient way to protect creative works, it is still a relatively new field and the legal implications of digital assets are still unclear. NFT complaints in China surge 300-fold in 2022 amid regulatory risks Digital piracy cannot be fought with laws alone, and NFTs offer an excellent solution for protecting creative works in the digital age. Only by providing a superior experience can creators safeguard their work. Fans will be incentivised to pay for a premium experience that can be accessed only through ownership of a specific NFT. This technology also provides an easy way for creators to secure their assets and ensure they can get rewarded for their efforts. NFTs can lay the foundation for new business models for creators and many traditional businesses. Digital assets are poised to revolutionise the creative industry as the digital asset space continues to expand. They provide a secure and profitable solution for creative professionals, allowing them to safeguard and monetise their digital works while offering fans exceptional and exclusive experiences.

The collapse of FTX, once the second-largest crypto exchange in the world, sent shock waves through the market. This caused some people to cast doubt on the future of Web3, which has long been conflated with cryptocurrency even though it is supposed to encompass so much more. Still, many have not given up on blockchain technology and the dream of a decentralised web. Yat Siu, chairman and co-founder of Hong Kong-based Animoca Brands, said he worried about the reputational damage to Web3 from FTX˚}˚}˚}s bankruptcy. But his commitment to Web3 as a ˚}˚}˚}natural evolution of the internet˚}˚}˚} remains unshaken. Shanghai˚}˚}˚}s Web3 support draws scepticism from crypto community A similar sentiment can be found among many of the Web3 faithful, but for observers, it is not always clear what people are actually referring to when they use the term. So here is a look at what Web3 is and why it is more than just a blockchain-based internet. What is Web3? Web3 is the hypothetical next-generation version of the World Wide Web that is decentralised and distributed through the use of blockchain and similar technologies. The term is often conflated with cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the metaverse because it has risen in prominence at the same time and uses some of the same underlying concepts, but it encompasses much more than just blockchain-based assets and virtual worlds. Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood coined the term Web 3.0 2014, three years before starting the Web3 Foundation, to refer to a version of the web where user information is not stored and controlled in centralised servers. Inspired by the Edward Snowden leaks the previous year ˚}˚}˚} which detailed the broad scope of data collection by US intelligence services ˚}˚}˚} Wood imagines a web based around public key infrastructure that secures user identities and that identifies content by its hash signature instead of an address pointing to a specific server. Hash functions like SHA-256, which is used in the bitcoin blockchain, convert data into values of a fixed size. These hash values can be used to identify and fetch content in a process considered central to Web3. Graphic: SCMP Jay Graber, project lead for the Twitter-backed decentralised social media initiative Bluesky, refers to this new era as ˚}˚}˚}the signed web˚}˚}˚}, with Web 2.0 being ˚}˚}˚}the posted web˚}˚}˚} and what is now called Web 1.0 being ˚}˚}˚}the hosted web˚}˚}˚}. By her account, the Web 1.0 era was defined by requiring users to run their own servers to host read-only websites. Web 2.0 gave rise to user-generated content hosted by central authorities like YouTube or Facebook. With Web3, though, content is always discoverable through its cryptographic signature, whether a specific platform decides to host that content or not. Many internet users may be most familiar with this type of technology through BitTorrent, which uses magnet links encoded with file hashes to identify the content to download.

What does Web3 have to do with cryptocurrencies and NFTs? With blockchain as the backbone, Web3 is often envisioned as incentivising user participation with crypto tokens such as ether. But the vision of Web3 is much broader than blockchain alone, which would be a very inefficient way of managing a web of content. Public blockchains cannot store large files because of the time it would take to update the distributed ledger. This has led to new decentralised technologies meant to address blockchain˚}˚}˚}s limitations. One of those technologies is the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). This identifies files by their hash so that anyone hosting that content can serve it when it is requested. While IPFS is not blockchain-based, it operates under some of the same cryptographic principles for identifying and retrieving information. It is maintained by Protocol Labs, which has also developed Filecoin, a cryptocurrency meant to help reward users for sharing their storage using IPFS.

For the uninitiated, the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency may seem mysterious or confusing. But strip away the jargon, and decentralised finance, or DeFi, is simply a shift away from the traditional system for managing money. It provides the services and functions of traditional finance (TradFi), but removes the centralised institutions acting as gatekeepers, such as a central bank or government agency. While the shift from TradFi to DeFi is a gradual process, it has been quickly picking up momentum, as evidenced by the waves of people moving away from traditional ways of managing their money to turn towards this new financial system. Julian Hosp, the co-founder of Singapore-based fintech platform Cake DeFi, discusses why he believes DeFi is an emerging financial technology worth adopting. Julian Hosp is the co-founder of Cake DeFi, a fintech platform based in Singapore. 1. DeFi is inclusive and accessible for most people Within a TradFi framework, there are intermediaries such as banks and brokerages to ensure checks and balances, which can be useful but also restrictive. ˚}˚}˚}This inevitably creates discrimination, where large swathes of the population do not have access to that system for a variety of reasons,˚}˚}˚} Hosp says. ˚}˚}˚}With DeFi, all you pretty much need is internet access in order to access the system.˚}˚}˚} 2. DeFi is easy to learn if you are curious DeFi may seem intimidating to new users, but Hosp believes that anyone with a willingness to learn and dabble in something different will find that there is a world of possibilities available. He cites a recent meet-up in Munich where he met people whose lives had been touched by DeFi ˚}˚}˚} from a single mother who turned to DeFi to help tide her over financially during Covid-19 lockdowns, to an older gentleman who scaled back on his day job and focused on drawing an income from the DeFi ecosystem so that he could spend more time with his dying father. Anyone, regardless of their background, can tap into the blockchain-based decentralised finance system to earn passive income, according to Hosp. ÅEEøΩÅEEøΩÅEEøΩThis open system gives literally 8 billion people the same kind of opportunity, and thatÅEEøΩEÅEEøΩÅEEøΩEs what is so exciting about this,ÅEEøΩEÅEEøΩÅEEøΩE Hosp says. 3. DeFi does not discriminate In a TradFi ecosystem, there is always the risk of human error. Whether that manifests as a bankÅEEøΩEÅEEøΩÅEEøΩEs credit community approving a high-risk loan, credit being denied to a worthy borrower, or simply an individual partyÅEEøΩEÅEEøΩÅEEøΩEs personal bias, there are myriad ways in which certain groups or individuals can be put at a disadvantage.

One reason for this was that news of the digital yuan came just after Facebook announced its own digital currency called Libra, later renamed Diem and killed after its assets were sold off. While the warning signs of regulatory hurdles facing Facebook were apparent from the beginning, it was not clear three years ago that Facebook, one of the world˚}˚}˚}s largest tech companies, would fail. So Beijing moved up its timeline to launch the e-CNY. Mu Changchun, head of the People˚}˚}˚}s Bank of China˚}˚}˚}s (PBOC) digital currency research institute, said that year that the digital yuan ˚}˚}˚}isn˚}˚}˚}t bitcoin and is not for speculation˚}˚}˚}. While authorities have promoted the use of blockchain for cross-border financing and settlements, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) typically have very little in common. Facebook˚}˚}˚}s Libra was a short-lived experiment in digital currencies. It was eventually rebranded as Diem, but it failed to get off the ground because of regulatory hurdles. Photo: DPA China, as the only large economy to have trialled a national digital currency, is demonstrative of this fact, and other central banks are showing little interest in using blockchain to manage digital cash. Here is why. What makes a CBDC different from cryptocurrency? While the digital yuan attracted broad attention with comparisons to blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, the reality is that CBDCs are almost as different from each other as bitcoin is from the cash in your bank account. This is because blockchain is unlikely to be used to mint CBDCs. Other database technologies are better suited for scaling across entire populations. When it was created in 2009, blockchain˚}˚}˚}s biggest asset was that it was the first peer-to-peer currency that did not need a central authority or server. CBDCs obviously do not operate like this, as they would be part of the greater money supply that is directly managed by a central bank. ˚}˚}˚}If we look at modern database technologies, they˚}˚}˚}re good enough for securing transactions,˚}˚}˚} said Jan Ondrus, associate dean of faculty and associate professor of information systems at the ESSEC Business School˚}˚}˚}s Asia-Pacific campus in Singapore, who has studied mobile payment technologies for two decades. ˚}˚}˚}And that˚}˚}˚}s what banks are using. That˚}˚}˚}s what most of us use on a daily basis when we use any kind of applications. When you check your emails on Gmail, or when you write on Google Docs, texts, all of this is stored in a centralised, secure way. So it works.˚}˚}˚} Why China is investing heavily in blockchain Most of today˚}˚}˚}s money supply is already little more than numbers on a computer. In some ways, CBDCs are an extension of that. The main difference is that the central bankÅE}ÅE}ÅE}s backing means that it is a liability directly held by the government institution. Today, the general public does not have access to liabilities from a central bank. Instead, that process goes through consumer-facing banks and other approved financial institutions.

Their value has shot up over the past year as enthusiasts tout their ability to allow the trading of digital assets, with collections of cartoon avatars and digital artworks being sold for millions of dollars in some cases. However, after a surge in interest earlier this year, there are some signs that the global NFT market is cooling, with unique buyers of NFTs in March dropping to 664,077 from a peak of 998,271 in January, and global sales also falling to US$2.4 billion from US$4.6 billion in January, according to data from market tracker CryptoSlam.

At the time, his company was building some of the technical infrastructure for China˚}˚}˚}s wide-scale push into smart cities. It was a period when trades in fast-rising bitcoin and other virtual currencies became widespread while blockchain start-ups with very little to show made millions on initial coin offerings.

But an endorsement from President Xi Jinping in late 2019 completely turned things around. More than a year later, China has launched its own ˚}˚}˚}internet for blockchain˚}˚}˚} called the Blockchain Service Network. A number of both private and public organisations have also implemented blockchain in a variety of use cases, including remittances, cross-border settlements, and travel, among many others. This does not mean cryptocurrencies have gained favour in China. Just weeks after Xi called for more research and investment in blockchain, China initiated another cryptocurrency crackdown. There also continues to be confusion about the role of blockchain in China˚}˚}˚}s new digital yuan, if any. Still, China has wasted no time forging ahead with blockchain, betting that it will be a critical technology in the future. This could put it on the same level as 5G and artificial intelligence, raising concerns in the US as it looks for ways to counter China˚}˚}˚}s influence in these areas. But what exactly is blockchain and how is China using it today? Here is a primer on where the country stands with the technology. What is blockchain? Blockchain is effectively a permanent log of transactions. The digital list of records is designed to be difficult to alter without being detected. It does this with a clever bit of math that finally allowed the blockchain concept to jump from an idea into the real world with bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that launched in 2009. The digital list is stored in so-called blocks, each containing the transaction time and data. To ensure that the list stays secure, transactions require the use of cryptographic hash functions ˚}˚}˚} effectively difficult math problems ˚}˚}˚} and proof-of-work problems that verify each block that came before it. Hash functions like SHA-256, which is used in the bitcoin blockchain, convert data into values of a fixed size. These values can then be used to verify the integrity of the original data, ensuring it has not been tampered with. Graphic: SCMP For bitcoin, this solved the problem of needing a centralised server to control the creation and management of a digital currency. Instead, the first blockchain was a peer-to-peer distributed ledger without any central authority, allowing anyone to participate and run their own bitcoin server. These types of open blockchains are called permissionless blockchains. In contrast, permissioned blockchains are closed to the public, offering more control, which has allowed the technology to continue to thrive in China. Since blockchain is an open source technology, people soon found uses for it beyond cryptocurrency. Ethereum, for example, advanced the idea of ˚}˚}˚}smart contracts˚}˚}˚}, allowing people to add their own features to the blockchain such as holding funds in escrow or automatic payments.

This is made worse by the perception that Chinese consumer protection law has been slow to protect consumers˚}˚}˚} rights. Changes to regulations in 2014 were the first major overhaul to the country˚}˚}˚}s consumer protection law in about two decades, requiring retailers to prove their innocence against counterfeiting allegations ˚}˚}˚} rather than consumers being required to prove wrongdoing ˚}˚}˚} and provide returns within seven days for the first time. With limited legal recourse and no tools to trace the origins or quality of products, consumers came to rely on big foreign brands, such as Nestle and P&G, to not cut corners and to provide products with reliable ingredients. The assumption was that foreign brands had passed more stringent regulation and provided better product guarantees. A Chinese man selects milk powder at a supermarket in Beijing on July 9, 2010. Photo: AFP Companies spend millions of dollars a year encoding information into the amorphous concept of a brand, including information about origin and material. For example, many of the luxury brands are associated with Paris or Milan, and their leather products. For health foods and quality ingredients, many Chinese consumers think of Australia. But because they often ride on status and prestige, brands can be unreliable as indicators of quality and safety. How recognisable a brand is has become more important than the history, quality, and standards behind the names. It is also easy and common in China to create fake products capitalising on the cachet of everything from Starbucks to Gucci. Start-up launches blockchain-based service to improve donation efficiency The main reason information about products has been difficult to track is the complexity of the supply chain. Hundreds of suppliers are involved in the manufacturing of many everyday goods and collecting information from each of these suppliers would be overwhelmingly expensive with traditional technology. Blockchain technology could help fill this vacuum in reliable information about product supply chains, offering the opportunity for supply chains to share data related to their products via a common and transparent solution. The technology behind cryptocurrencies stores records in a network of computers, with each record or ˚}˚}˚}block˚}˚}˚} linked to earlier ones and secured by cryptography, making it difficult to tamper with. Because of this, it provides a reliable way to track supply chain information such as the geographic flow of products and their components, official certifications, as well as flaws and anomalies.

Photo: Reuters For example, blockchain could help identify chemicals in baby milk formula that should not be there, or track down the specific factory that introduced a design flaw that caused a chest of drawers to fall on its buyers. It also presents opportunities for manufacturers and suppliers: having more data about everything from raw materials to distribution to after-sale support would maximise efficiency for producers, and also give companies a way to differentiate genuine products from knock-offs. Counterfeit goods can harm consumers and damage a brand, and blockchain provides a way for companies finally to offer hard data to reassure consumers.

The Sandbox chief operating officer Sebastien Borget said his primary consideration right now is how to defend the metaverse against forays by Big Tech firms like Meta, the owner of Facebook, which recently changed its name to reflect commitment to the new trend. Chinese tech giants like Tencent Holdings and NetEase have also sought to capitalise on the trend. It is more than just competition, the executive said, because the metaverse is about bringing down the old guard of the internet using decentralised technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies. ˚}˚}˚}Our goal is to build an open metaverse that can stand against what we call competition that is the Web 2.0 metaverses˚}˚}˚}, Borget said.

Photo: Handout The Sandbox, which launched its first metaverse alpha test in November, has quickly become one of the most talked-about start-ups in the industry. The company closed a new round of US$93 million in funding last month, led by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, making it the first investment into crypto assets for the SoftBank Vision Fund 2. The South China Morning Post also has a partnership with The Sandbox, where it is looking to build experiences. The platform˚}˚}˚}s owner Pixowl was acquired by Hong Kong-based gaming unicorn Animoca Brands in 2018. Its transformation into a blockchain-based platform has made it the poster child of the so-called Web 3.0 movement, which advocates for a future internet based on decentralised, public blockchains. The Web 3.0, a term coined by Ethereum blockchain co-founder Gavin Wood, seeks to disrupt Big Tech companies by moving away from the Web 2.0 era, which has given rise to web platforms that collect and monetise user data stored on central servers. The movement originated in Silicon Valley, but it has been gaining steam worldwide in recent months. The metaverse is one of the hottest buzzwords in tech this year, as many consider it the next iteration of the internet that will see people interacting and trading in 3D virtual environments. What it should ultimately look like remains hotly debated, but many crypto and blockchain enthusiasts believe Big Tech are the enemies of a decentralised metaverse. ˚}˚}˚}The way [Big Tech] projects the vision of creating the metaverse is really lacking diversity,˚}˚}˚} Borget said. ˚}˚}˚}We don˚}˚}˚}t think those companies can build something truly fun that˚}˚}˚}s catered to the users because they˚}˚}˚}ve been so focused on their key business model and how to satisfy shareholders rather than satisfy users who own the asset, who own the governance of their own platform.˚}˚}˚} How a big bet on blockchain and NFTs minted Hong Kong˚}˚}˚}s latest unicorn The Sandbox and other Web 3.0 start-ups claim that their platforms, unlike traditional conglomerates, are governed by a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO), where users can propose and vote on changes to the platform.

China Central Television (CCTV) fired warning shots in two reports over games that encourage people to play in order to earn cryptocurrencies, depicting them as scams. The environment for cryptocurrencies in China turned sour after Beijing banned cryptocurrency trading and mining in the country, viewing the industry as a threat to financial stability. The CCTV reports put the spotlight on two intermediaries in the northwestern province of Shaanxi and the southeastern province Fujian, which help Chinese citizens to participate in play-to-earn games. Both operators said they can provide services to help users access a game called Farmers World, offering players the chance to earn monthly returns of more than 10,000 yuan (US$1,570). CCTV said the offers were a scam. Can cartoon apes land these NFT owners a fortune? Play-to-earn games have become one of the hottest tech trends this year, with multiple blockchain game developers seeing their valuations mushroom to billions of dollars in the span of a few months. However, such games have come under increasing scrutiny due to their surging popularity. CCTV alleged that some of these games are simply low-budget webpage games, which cheat players. CCTV quoted experts who said some of these games allowed older players to profit simply because new players have to pay entry fees, not unlike Ponzi schemes. In one report, a CCTV reporter visited a company called Renren Liang Metaverse Research Center in Fujian, where a company director said that a player of Farmers World could be expected to earn a 100 per cent return between 22 and 40 days after buying an an-game item, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars. But during this process, the player would have to pay a 6,000 yuan service fee to the company, and also allow the company to take 20 per cent of returns. Farmers World is basically a simulation game, where a player picks tools, exploits resources, and buys land to build enormous farms, and trades items within a virtual farming ecosystem. Chinese state media warns against NFT ÅEEøΩEÅEEøΩÅEEøΩEzero-sum gameÅEEøΩEÅEEøΩÅEEøΩE In another trip, a reporter visited a company named Shaanxi Juxin Software Technology, where the representative also boasted of 100 per cent returns within a month for players of Farmers World. The company also demands a 20 per cent take from player returns. Famers World did not immediately reply to questions sent by the South China Morning Post via email. While the game has a website and presence across many social media platforms, it is unclear who the developer is. Play-to-earn games are currently red-hot. Three-year-old Vietnamese game Axie Infinity grabbed a US$3 billion valuation in its latest funding round last month while Hong Kong firm Animoca Brands became a unicorn in May with its slate of play-to-earn games, including The Sandbox. These games were not mentioned by the CCTV reports.

Under proposed new rules, companies and entities operating in China that provide blockchain-based information services will have to ask users to register their real names and national identification card numbers, censor content deemed to pose a threat to national security and store user data to allow inspection by authorities. The Cyberspace Administration of China published the draft regulations on its website on Friday for public consultation until November 2. It is not clear when the rules will come into effect. The latest rules come after an activist in China published an open letter in April about an alleged cover-up of sexual harassment at a top university more than two decades ago on the ethereum blockchain, after the post attracted censors on social media platforms such as WeChat and Weibo. The anonymous poster attached the letter to an ether transaction to himself, in a move similar to leaving a note in a bank transfer. But since all transaction records are public on ethereum, the letter can be read by anyone. Blockchain data accepted as evidence in law suit filed by short video app Douyin One of the key issues that the new rules did not address is that blockchain is a technology in which data is not changeable or erasable, which runs contrary to Chinese laws governing user data, Beijing-based lawyer Xu Kai wrote in an online column. The new rules also lack enforcement procedures to protect the rights of blockchain platforms, Xu noted. Social media platforms powered by blockchain typically allow users to post in anonymity, without a centralised entity controlling their data. One popular example is US-based start-up Steemit, where users can obtain tradeable tokens for posting, discovering and commenting on content. There is not yet a similar service taking off in China. Matters, a Chinese-language, blockchain-based version of Reddit based in Hong Kong, is currently invitation-only and under testing. China has already put in place regulations that require real-name registration for online services from social networking apps to online discussion forums. The latest rules targeting blockchain media platforms are in line with existing regulations, which came into force after Beijing implemented a sweeping cybersecurity law in 2017 that has raised privacy concerns. Is China intensifying its crackdown on cryptocurrencies? A new set of regulations released earlier this month gives public security authorities the power to enter premises of all companies that provide internet services and inspect and copy data relevant to cybersecurity.

The shake-up appeared to consolidate power at the sprawling internet company, although it included no firings or outside hires and did not change the role of either Zuckerberg or Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. Chris Cox, the chief product officer in charge of the flagship Facebook service, will now also oversee the widely used services Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, the company said. WhatsApp has been given a relatively free hand since 2014, when Facebook bought it for $22 billion, but in recent months its two co-founders have announced their resignations, opening the door to closer integration.

It has separate columns for debit and credit, as well as a starting and ending balance for each account. These have existed for thousands of years, arising from the time when people started trading goods and services, and needed to keep records of transactions. A so-called distributed ledger is collectively maintained by all those taking part in such a system, rather than by one central authority or clearing house. Whenever a transaction takes place, this information is shared between system participants and added as a new ledger entry. Blockchain, a form of distributed ledger technology, burst onto the scene when cryptocurrency bitcoin was introduced by its pseudonymous inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, through a technical paper published in October 2008. Information for this explainer was gathered from an interview with Paul Tomes and Nick Murray, the co-founders of start-up PassKit, and from a Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute white paper on blockchain, which was commissioned by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. What is a blockchain? Simply put, a blockchain is a distributed online database of transactions that multiple parties share and everyone can trust. Each participant in this blockchain network maintains their own copy of that database, or collection of organised information. A blockchain, which provides a protocol or arrangement for building a shared and replicated online ledger network, makes constantly available for examination a full audit trail of transaction history. In terms of structure, it is made up of a series of ÅEEøΩEÅEEøΩÅEEøΩEblocksÅEEøΩEÅEEøΩÅEEøΩE of information that are securely chained together. Any given digital record of an asset, be it a copy of the title deeds of a bricks-and-mortar property or a virtual commodity, can be stored in a block. New blocks are formed whenever participants create or change a piece of information about an asset, such as changes of status, new market prices or new owners. What makes a blockchain secure? Transactions on a blockchain database are processed one at a time.

Soon after, Hong Kong-based Techhub News reported that at least three executives from Huobi had been taken away by mainland police as part of an investigation, with other employees asked to leave the country. The report cited unnamed sources. Huobi denied the allegations in an email to the Post.

In June, the World Bank estimated that the global economy could shrink by 5.2 per cent this year ˚}˚}˚} the deepest recession since the end of World War II. But some entrepreneurs have beat the odds and found new opportunities by embracing digital technology in their everyday operations. Using tools such as online payment platforms and blockchain record-keeping systems, these five business owners across Asia have managed to sustain and grow their operations during this difficult period. Clawing back towards profit One Chinese entrepreneur who has benefited from digital transformation is Mo Jiaxuan, the owner of Beijing-based claw machine arcade chain MOMO Fun Star. Mo founded the business in 2015, when he decided to turn his hobby into a business. His journey since then had been largely successful ˚}˚}˚} last year, the company was running 18 profitable arcades and planned to open 180 more across China, Mo said. Then the pandemic turned those plans upside down. As people were urged to stay home, Mo˚}˚}˚}s arcades recorded zero profit and struggled to pay rent. Mo Jiaxuan, owner of a Beijing-based claw machine arcade chain, developed a virtual claw machine game for the Alipay platform. Illustration: Brian Wang But in March, his company made a comeback after teaming up with Alipay ˚}˚}˚} a digital payment platform run by Ant Group ˚}˚}˚} to develop a virtual claw machine game. It was launched on the Alipay platform for its 1 billion users. Ant Group is an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding, the Chinese e-commerce giant that also owns the South China Morning Post. To play the game, users purchased tokens in the Alipay app. Mo said that within a day, some 200,000 people had virtually queued to buy the tokens, and revenue increased fivefold compared with pre-pandemic levels. Mo said the mobile game˚}˚}˚}s success also allowed his company to engage with players across China. ˚}˚}˚}Opportunities often appear in desperate situations ˚}˚}˚} maybe this is life,˚}˚}˚} he added. Lifeline during lockdown In the central Chinese city of Wuhan, digital payment tools helped another entrepreneur to stay afloat during the early months of the pandemic. In 2016, Qiu Mengyi opened a nail salon after graduating from university, and accumulated more than 1,300 loyal customers over the years. In mid-January, however, her business was closed when Wuhan was placed under lockdown. In the midst of this difficult situation, she received much-needed financial support via a mobile app. Qiu Mengyi obtained an interest-free loan from MYbank to sustain her nail salon business in Wuhan. Illustration: Brian Wang MYbank, a virtual bank under Ant Group, partnered with 100 Chinese banks to offer interest-free loans to 10 million small- and medium-sized enterprises. Using the bankÅE}ÅE}ÅE}s app, Qiu successfully applied for a US$7,000 interest-free loan, which proved to be crucial to sustaining her salon until the lockdown was lifted in ",Tech,Related to Blockchain,"South China Morning Post, News, Opinion, China, Hong Kong, World, US, Asia, Business, Economy, Technology, Lifestyle, Sport",South China Morning Post

After investment fervour pushed prices past US$63,000 in April, its value then plummeted by more than 40 per cent. Beijing, concerned by the volatility, announced another crackdown on the cryptocurrency. This time, it went after a practice previously assumed to be safe: bitcoin mining. Local governments across mainland China have responded by pushing out cryptocurrency miners, forcing some of these enterprises to seek a new home overseas. Experts previously raised concerns about China˚}˚}˚}s influence over the bitcoin market, since it accounted for 65 per cent of the decentralised network last year, but a declining share of mining is changing that situation. Here is everything you need to know about bitcoin and what China˚}˚}˚}s crackdown means for the future of the cryptocurrency that started it all. What is bitcoin? Born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, bitcoin was designed by an anonymous person or group, known only as Satoshi Nakamoto, as a peer-to-peer digital currency free from any central authority. Rather than being widely adopted as a full-fledged currency outside the domain of political influence as some had hoped, bitcoin˚}˚}˚}s design instead has become its most lauded technical contribution. Blockchain, a clever open-source solution to a very difficult problem, is what makes the world˚}˚}˚}s first cryptocurrency viable. It is a distributed ledger technology that is collectively maintained by all those taking part, rather than by one central authority or clearing house. The principal innovation of blockchain was to introduce scarcity to digital goods and has since been put to other uses such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Why China is investing heavily in blockchain What is bitcoin mining? Unlike a traditional fiat currency, typically managed by a central bank, the blockchain has set rules governing how long it takes to create a new unit of digital currency. This is done by hashing or solving hash functions, requiring large amounts of computing power. For large, mature blockchains, like those of bitcoin and Ethereum, the hash rate is usually given in terahashes, or trillions of hashes, per second (TH/s). Before BeijingÅE}ÅE}ÅE}s crackdown, the hash rate peaked on May 14 at more than 180 million TH/s, according to blockchain.com. Seven weeks later, the rate had halved. Hash functions are effectively complex math problems that turn variable data ",Tech,Related to Blockchain,"bitcoin, china cryptocurrency, china bitcoin, bitcoin crackdown, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia",South China Morning Post

Over the past year, Michael Zhang, a 26-year-old telecommunications engineer based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, put 40,000 yuan (US$5,964) into cryptocurrencies, only to see his investment shrink to one eighth of its original value.

It did not take long, however, for Leung to realise that something was amiss. Instead of getting a newly minted NFT, the link sent money from his cryptocurrency wallet to an unfamiliar account bearing a name that starts with ˚}˚}˚}HuiY˚}˚}˚}. ˚}˚}˚}I was in an absolute hurry to try to click the link, which was posted by an administrator at Monkey Kingdom˚}˚}˚}s group chat on [instant messaging service] Discord at the time,˚}˚}˚} Leung said. ˚}˚}˚}I had every reason to believe that it was legit.

By the time the NFT project˚}˚}˚}s administrators detected the security breach and shut down all activities, buyers had lost more than 7,000 solana, a popular cryptocurrency, to the scam. That amounted to nearly US$1.3 million based on the latest transacted prices. 05:15 SCMP Explains: What are NFTs? SCMP Explains: What are NFTs? Phishing is a common form of online fraud to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into revealing sensitive information using fraudulent links or messages. It is now being employed to breach access to users˚}˚}˚} cryptocurrency wallets. The Monkey Kingdom case marked the latest in a series of scams to hit the NFT space in recent months, as demand for these digital assets continues to expand. NFTs refer to units of data stored on a blockchain, which guarantees each digital asset to be unique and immutable. As such, NFTs can be owned and traded much like physical items in the real world. The past year saw a boom in the NFT market, the value of which exceeded US$40 billion, according to blockchain data platform Chainalysis. SCMP A number of high-profile Hong Kong NFT projects have grabbed headlines, attracting new investors into this sector. The latest one involves the NFTs of popular cartoon piglet McDull and his cousin McMug, created by illustrator Alice Mak Ka-bik and writer Brian Tse Lap-man, which will be auctioned by Sotheby˚}˚}˚}s later this month. In December, the ˚}˚}˚}GOLD4HK˚}˚}˚} collection of 5,424 NFTs of Olympic gold medallist fencing hero Cheung Ka-long and his men˚}˚}˚}s foil team was announced for release. The South China Morning Post in November joined Dapper Labs, the creator of popular NFT series NBA Top Shot, to release a number of NFT trading cards commemorating the history of Hong Kong. In October, SothebyÅE}ÅE}ÅE}s auctioned an NFT of a never-before-seen, behind-the-scenes footage from the first day of shooting In the Mood for Love, the critically acclaimed 2000 film by director Wong Kar-wai.

While the broad 60 per cent or so declines in decentralised finance, or DeFi, tokens are generally in line with the recent plunge in digital stalwarts such as bitcoin and Ether, a closer look suggests something else is at work. Many of the tokens, which power applications that allow users to lend, borrow and trade crypto without intermediaries, are underpinned by stablecoins that don˚}˚}˚}t fluctuate much in value, according to DeFi yield-optimisation firm Novum Insights. That would suggest the decline is being driven by more than daily price fluctuations and too much leverage.

Just like the original painting of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci is more valuable than copies or duplicates, NFTs are virtual assets that (thanks to the blockchain) are also distinguishable from copies or duplicates. This concept has led to individuals being able to sell digital artworks and other collectibles and trade them as assets, safe in the knowledge they are selling or buying an original piece. NFTs have come to the fore in recent months as artists around the world have made millions by auctioning pieces of work as non-fungible tokens. Forget bitcoin, this Singapore firm is using blockchain to build a city Recent high profile NFTs have included collection of artworks by the musician Grimes, which sold for more than US$6 million, and a 10-second computer-generated video clip featuring a fallen giant Donald Trump, which sold for US$6.6 million. Top of the list is the Beeple piece bought by Vignesh, who heads Portkey Technologies, an information technology consulting firm. The purchase has propelled Vignesh and his business partner Anand Venkateswaran to the international stage as they are seen as having made art history. The pair, from Tamil Nadu, met in 2013 while working at Indian newspaper The Hindu, where Vignesh was a technology consultant and Anand a journalist. Vignesh moved to Singapore three years ago and built himself a career on the back of a series of cryptocurrency ventures and investments.

It wasnÅEEøΩÅEEøΩÅEEøΩt the trading in a financial instrument per se but in the online traffic in a column I had written in December 2013. The column examined the recent crash in the price of bitcoins which had plummeted to $600 from $1,200 in just two days. The headline read: ÅEEøΩÅEEøΩÅEEøΩThe bitcoin crash of 2013: DonÅEEøΩÅEEøΩÅEEøΩt you feel silly now?ÅEEøΩÅEEøΩÅEEøΩ What was causing the spike in readership of that piece more than three years later was that the price of bitcoins was surging toward $5,000 a point it breached during the day on Friday.

No I donÅEEøΩÅEEøΩÅEEøΩt feel silly but vindicated. If the recent run-up in bitcoin price proves anything itÅEEøΩÅEEøΩÅEEøΩs that the virtual currency is still a dumb investment.

To understand why we can start by scrutinizing the recent bitcoin surge ÅEEøΩEÅEEøΩÅEEøΩE or as financial historians might view it the bubble. Since Bitcoin is not backed by an underlying asset and instead has a fully fluctuating exchange rate... the idea of bubbles seems salient. ÅEEøΩEÅEEøΩÅEEøΩE Susan Athey et.al Stanford University First the surge is of very recent vintage. From the end of 2013 through January this year bitcoin as an investment was essentially dead money: Leaving aside some peaks and valleys it traded in the $800 to $900 range in December 2013 and about the same in December 2016. (IÅEEøΩE""a benchmark.) Bitcoin crossed the $1,000 barrier in earnest around the end of January and really took off at the end of March. From then through last week bitcoin quintupled in price.

The frenzy surrounding the virtual currency escalated just days before it starts trading on a major U.S. exchange. The frenzy even has parts of Wall Street concerned. A group of banks complained that federal regulators approved bitcoin futures which begin trading Sunday too quickly and without properly considering the inherent risks in the virtual currency. Around 10:40 a.m. Pacific Time one bitcoin was valued at $15,872 according to Coinbase; it briefly surged above $19,000 earlier in the day. Last week the price of a bitcoin topped $10,000 for the first time. At the start of the year it was worth less than $1,000. Coinbase the largest bitcoin exchange tweeted that record-high traffic had caused interruptions to its service Thursday. The price swings are occurring not long before bitcoin starts trading on two established U.S. exchanges. Futures for bitcoin will start trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange on Sunday evening and on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange a week later. The Futures Industry Assn. which represents Wall Street˚}˚}˚}s biggest banks and clearinghouses sent a letter to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission saying that as the guarantors of customers trades they should have been consulted before trading in bitcoin futures was approved. They expressed concern that the extreme volatility tied into bitcoin could leave banks exposed when the futures move too violently. The price swings are occurring just as the trading community prepares for bitcoin to start trading on two established U.S. exchanges. Futures for bitcoin will start trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange on Sunday evening and on crosstown rival CME Group˚}˚}˚}s platforms later in the month. That has increased the sense among some investors that bitcoin is gaining in mainstream legitimacy after several countries such as China tried to stifle the virtual currency. Bitcoin is the world˚}˚}˚}s most popular virtual currency. Such currencies are not tied to a bank or government and enable users to spend money anonymously. They are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they are traded. A debate is raging on the merits of such currencies. Some say they serve merely to facilitate money laundering and illicit anonymous payments. Others say they can be helpful methods of payment such as in crisis situations where national currencies have collapsed. Miners of bitcoins and other virtual currencies help keep the systems honest by having their computers keep a global running tally of transactions. That prevents cheaters from spending the same digital coin twice.

The chief executive of JPMorgan Chase has called bitcoin a ˚}˚}˚}fraud,˚}˚}˚} as it is based only on software code and is not backed by any monetary authority. Other executives including International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde say virtual currencies should not be dismissed and could have useful applications such as a means of payment in countries with unstable currencies. Some countries such as China have tried to stifle bitcoin exchanges. But in a move that gave further credibility to the virtual currency the U.S. exchange operator CME Group said last month that it plans to open a futures market for the currency before the end of the year if it can get approval from regulators. Bitcoin was created about a decade ago as an alternative to government-issued currencies. Transactions allow anonymity which has made it popular with people who want to keep their financial activity and their identities private. Whereas virtual currencies were initially used primarily as a method of payment in recent months they have become a hot investment among speculators. Daniele Bianchi an assistant professor of finance at the Warwick Business School in England said the price increases are due to rising demand but also to the fact that the supply of bitcoins is kept fixed.

At the Milken Institute Global Conference this week the MIT professor promoted Algorand a blockchain he developed that he says is greener faster and more secure than other protocols. Blockchains are typically described as public ledgers where transactions are recorded on an open network. Validating a set of transactions to add to the ledger is one of the biggest security challenges. Algorand says it uses a novel approach involving the random selection of its users to ensure blocks of transactions are more resistant to hacks which cost cryptocurrency holders a record $14 billion last year by one tally.

The machines in convenience stores gas stations and even bakeries are an easy way for people to buy cryptocurrency quickly with cash which is harder to track than a wire transfer or check. As scammers exploit the convenience these machines provide bitcoin ATMs are also attracting the attention of lawmakers regulators and consumer advocacy groups looking to protect people from fraud and exorbitant fees. Starting in January California will limit cryptocurrency ATM transactions to $1,000 per day per person under Senate Bill 401 which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law. Some bitcoin ATM machines advertise limits as high as $50,000. The new law also bars bitcoin ATM operators from collecting fees higher than $5 or 15% of the transaction whichever is greater starting in 2025. Legislative staff members visited a crypto kiosk in Sacramento and found markups as high as 33% on some digital assets when they compared the prices at which cryptocurrency is bought and sold. Typically a crypto ATM charges fees between 12% and 25% over the value of the digital asset according to a legislative analysis.

Voting by phone could be coming soon to an election near you. As seasoned disruptors of the status quo tech pioneers have proven persuasive in selling the idea even as the National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine specifically warn against any such experiment. The fight over mobile voting pits technologists who warn about the risks of entrusting voting to apps and cellphones against others who see internet voting as the only hope for getting most Americans to consistently participate on election day. ˚}˚}˚}There are so many things that could go wrong,˚}˚}˚} said Marian Schneider president of Verified Voting a coalition of computer scientists and government transparency advocates pushing for more-secure elections. ˚}˚}˚}It is an odd time for this to be gaining momentum.˚}˚}˚} Behind the vote-by-phone push is a political operative who grew rich helping Uber elbow its way onto city streets and Bird populate the sidewalks with electric scooters and who sees mobile voting as a potential cure for an ailing democracy. Bradley Tusk is using the same tactics in this personal crusade that he used to advance tech startups. He has bet a significant share of the fortune he built off his equity stake in Uber that the gospel of mobile voting will spread so fast that most Americans will have the option of casting their ballots for president by phone as soon as 2028. He has already persuaded the state of West Virginia and the City of Denver to start tinkering with voting by phone and hopes to move quickly from there. ˚}˚}˚}What we learned at Uber is once the genie is out of the bottle it can˚}˚}˚}t be put it back in,˚}˚}˚} said Tusk a venture capitalist who managed former New York Mayor Michael R.

In the tech world he invests in startups that face political and regulatory hurdles then helps knock those hurdles down by galvanizing the public˚}˚}˚}s appetite for game-changing innovations. Tusk is certain participation in elections would surge if the technology were widely permitted even though studies in some of the few places around the world that have tried the method revealed no big turnout boost.

The proof of concept which was conducted on the Avalanche Spruce institutional test Subnet found that smart-contract capabilities could deliver new functionality and operational efficiencies which are currently unavailable with traditional assets. These new functionalities could enable buy- and sell-side institutions to engage with distributed ledger infrastructure in a lowrisk low-barrier-to-entry manner that is consistent with regulations. Private markets although a $10-trillion asset class are characterized by an infrastructure that is complex and manual with a lack of standardization and transparency leading to inefficient distribution and operations. There are often complex legal and regulatory restrictions related to private assets. With ABN AMRO simulating the role of a traditional investor the proof of concept tested the tokenization of a Wellington-issued private equity fund by bringing it onto a distributed ledger technology (DLT) network. The underlying fund distribution rules were encoded into the smart contract and embedded in the token transferred to hypothetical WisdomTree clients. The proof of concept demonstrated how smart contracts could be used to enable greater automation and potentially create an enhanced compliance and control environment for issuers distributors and investors. As part of the experiment Citi also evaluated multiple scenarios of transfers using smart contracts relying on simulated identity credentials issued by WisdomTree and using a private fund token as collateral in an automated lending contract with DTCC Digital Assets (formerly Securrency).

Come Back Alive, a non-governmental organization that was formed in 2014 after Russian-backed forces invaded Crimea, was gifted $400,000 worth of the digital currency during a 12-hour span on Thursday, according to CNBC. The blockchain analytics firm Elliptic is tracking donations to Come Back Alive and other Ukrainian NGOs on the ground as Russian troops make advances into the heart of the country. The donations are being used to purchase equipment and supplies for Ukrainian soldiers and medics. The NGOs are also reportedly using the funds to develop facial recognition apps to identify Russian mercenaries or spies. The use of cryptocurrency is appealing since cross-border transactions can be made without the involvement of financial institutions. Come Back Alive started accepting cryptocurrency in 2018. Other groups including the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance has received upward of $100,000 in bitcoin, ether, and litecoin, among other digital currencies. According to Elliptic, the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance has been engaged in hacks and cyberattacks against Russian entities since 2016. Last year, Ukraine legalized bitcoin. Before the parliament unanimously voted to approve the use of regulated cryptocurrency, the exchange of virtual assets existed in a legal gray area.

When Christie˚}˚}˚}s auctioned off an NFT for more than $69 million in March, it propelled the concept squarely into the public spotlight ˚}˚}˚} with everything from iconic sports moments to memes being memorialized into NFTs and sold often for staggering prices. But the movement can seem daunting and confusing to outsiders. Here is what it˚}˚}˚}s all about: Fundamentally, NFTs are one-of-a-kind, verifiable digital assets that are traded on blockchain technology. That˚}˚}˚}s a high-tech way of saying it˚}˚}˚}s a bit of data representing something unique, or at least scarce, that allows the owner to prove the asset is theirs. In that way, they˚}˚}˚}re a bit like limited-edition sneakers, or collectable stamps. But instead of receiving the physical objects, buyers of NFTs receive a digital file that claims ownership of some asset, whether it be a piece of digital art, a sports highlight, song ÅE}ÅE}ÅE} or even a fart. NFTs differ from cryptocurrency in that there are many bitcoins and theyÅE}ÅE}ÅE}re all interchangeable, whereas NFTs each have a unique identifying code that exists on the blockchain. Put another way, NFTs are not interchangeable. The idea is that NFTs create a degree of scarcity on the internet, where most things currently exist in infinite supply. Just because something is turned into an NFT, though, that doesnÅE}ÅE}ÅE}t mean all copies of it will disappear from the internet ÅE}ÅE}ÅE} just that there will only be one authentic original of the asset. NFTs are recorded on blockchain technology, which youÅE}ÅE}ÅE}ve likely heard of as the underpinning infrastructure for cryptocurrencies.

Then come Web 3.0 games utilizing blockchain technology. The rapid development of gaming and Web 3.0 industries in Vietnam has drawn global attention to the promising digital economy with plenty of room for further growth and numerous possibilities. ""Despite being among the top downloads, Vietnam has no gaming firms rated in the top 200 for greatest income, indicating that revenue from in-app purchases remains low.

These articles will delve into trend analysis, and market forecasting, and point out the pros and cons of each project and technology. This will reveal the true stories about blockchain characters and projects for mass reades.
As companion to the site, DTS anticipates potential projects in the Vietnamese Blockchain market. DTS Alliance experts and member organizations also play a big role in validating projects to ensure transparency and feasibility. Together with VnExpress, DTS will organize national and international blockchain-related events connecting industry experts to support start-ups in the field.
From on-site articles, both readers and investors can equip themselves with knowledge on the field. Broadening knowledge will help investors know how to observe, evaluate, and orient properly before deciding to participate in this technology or channeling money into a project.
Currently, Blockchain is becoming the global trending, which is applied in fields like real estate, healthcare, education, transportation, and state management. Besides, this technology also opens the trend of digital economies based on Metaverse, GameFi, DeFi, NFTs... with billions of dollars invested.
Immerging in the global blockchain trend, Vietnam is forecasted by many experts as one of the pioneering markets. According to the announcement from Chainalysis, Vietnam is currently the leading country in terms of crypto adoption indexes in 2021.
At the Binance Blockchain week in Dubai this March, according to statistics, out of 10 games achieving the highest revenue in the ecosystem were two products from Vietnamese developers. Vietnam is also in the top 10 of Binance's markets across multiple product lines.
However, according to experts, currently, the majority of investors are still not fully aware of blockchain. The market also has many potential risks. By supporting VnExpress' Blockchain website, DTS aims to create an ecosystem that supports the experience and knowledge of businesses and start-ups in this field. At the same time, DTS will connect Vietnamese businesses and start-ups with foreign investors and project developers.

An NFT game combines conventional gaming designs with unconventional game mechanisms to let users have more control over in-game assets such as skins, characters, weapons, and virtual lands.
This year many M2E games have hit the market and become popular among blockchain lovers.
Minh Thanh of HCM City said he runs some 40 km a week. When the running app StepN was launched a month ago, he was reluctant to join because players have to pay at least US$1,000 to buy NTFs in the form of sneakers.
He recently signed up with a domestic running app because it allows players to enjoy free trials before official registration.
An M2E app named Calo Metaverse has been downloaded over 50,000 times, with some 7,200 people playing it daily.
Another app called Run Together said it sold out 7,413 ShoeBox NFTs within 30 minutes of launch. After six days it had been downloaded more than 15,000 times with over 3,000 people playing it daily.
Some new M2E projects are about to be launched.
M2E apps developed by Vietnamese focus on more on the community and increasing interactions between players and groups of players.
Phan Tuan, CEO of Calo Metaverse, said: We have defined Calo as an ecosystem,  not an app. After developing its user base via the M2E mechanism, it will center on building a virtual world to connect and practice.""

Run Together directs players to running communities in the real world and organizes marathons.

Vietnamese operators of M2E apps center on connection among players instead of merely letting them run to earn money, Le Khai, CMO of Run Together, said.

""In late May, we will ... organize a race in the Mekong Delta city of Can Tho.""

Some Vietnamese projects also build their own platforms, allowing professional athletes to participate and inspire.

Tuan said: ""The career of athletes is usually not long. Therefore, we create an extra playground for celebrities in the sports field to turn items and medals in their competitive career into NFTs to increase incomes and lead the community.""

Thanh Binh, the administrator of an M2E running group with more than 7,000 members, said initially most invested in StepN but now more are joining Vietnamese projects.

According to Binh, domestic M2E projects are attractive due to two reasons: They cost less to join and understand local communities, focus on community building and have direct interactions.

""If you play StepN, you have to spend about $1,000 to buy shoes. But with Vietnamese projects, players only need $100 to participate. Many projects offer free NFTs for a long time.""

Wu Blockchain, a cryptocurrency analysis site, pointed out that if a blockchain game has too many people making rather than spending money, it would be a pyramid scheme, meaning money collected from old players is being used to pay new ones.

But M2E projects also face challenges such as difficulty in convincing the community they are not scams and the fact that blockchain technology, NFTs and cryptocurrencies are too new for many people.

According to analysts, it is too early to conclude if M2E is just a fad or a new direction after P2E once made Vietnam a bright spot on the world blockchain map.

Many M2E applications are expected to be the next Axie Infinity, but skeptics warn that the M2E ecosystem would remain unstable as long the earnings factor is not balanced with the communityÅEEøΩEs physical activity goals.",Business,Related to Blockchain,"Move to earn, blockchain, games, Vietnam",VNExpress

We have 10 businesses working in blockchain and having a capitalization of over $100 million. Vietnam's blockchain unicorns have also raised their global influencehe said.

Tung said blockchain technology is groundbreaking. As the numbers of engineers and businesses increase, their need for connection and sharing grows too. The existence of a blockchain association therefore is necessary.

""I hope the association could be a place for both organizations and individuals to share their experience and resources to foster research and trials, therefore contributing to the nation's digital transformation and the development of a digital economy and society,"" Tung said.

Hoang Van Huay, head of Vietnam Blockchain Association, said the technology is being used by several countries in multiple fields. The association will also be an important foundation for blockchain technology to be used in Vietnam's economic and social activities, he added.

Phan Duc Trung, deputy head of the association, said international cooperation would open up new opportunities for blockchain firms, helping Vietnam attract more international investments.

""Investors from all around the world are ready to participate in summits about blockchain in Vietnam. Vietnam could be a cradle for the global field of blockchain, not just as a competitor to Singapore, if we have the appropriate legal frameworks for it,"" Trung said.

Huy Nguyen, deputy head of the association, said the public need to be educated on blockchain technologies and that such technologies should be applied in everyday life. In another five years, blockchain would be present in all aspects of life in Vietnam, he anticipated.

Vietnam Blockchain Association aims to develop its members, build membership standards, inform the public and provide opinions on policies, among other purposes.

The most prominent of them, Sky Mavis, the latest tech unicorn and developer of popular non-fungible token-based online video game Axie Infinity, was founded in Vietnam in 2018. The majority of its core team is also in Vietnam, with its staff located in HCMC.
But it is legally headquartered in Singapore. Other top Vietnamese blockchain startups, including KardiaChain, Kyber Network and Tomochain, also have their offices and staff in Vietnam but headquarter in the island nation. Cris Duy Tran, co-founder of FAM Central and managing director of Vietnam Startup Investment Fund, said it is not uncommon for blockchain companies to choose Singapore, Hong Kong or Malaysia to register their headquarters due to the favorable policies there. Vietnam has yet to frame regulations for the industry, and so it is inconvenient for companies to operate in the country or raise capital, he explained. Huy Nguyen, co-founder of public blockchain platform KardiaChain and former tech lead manager at Google, said he chose Singapore due to its clear and internationally recognized legal regulations. ""This is a common trend globally, not just among Vietnamese startups. Singapore is [also] chosen due to its close proximity [to Vietnam] and affordable costs"". StartupsÅEEøΩE hurdles Nguyen Thanh Trung, CEO of Sky Mavis, said startups prefer the island country because of capital. ""e expanding into the international market, companies find it easier to receive foreign investment in Singapore than in Vietnam. Singaporean laws and regulations are also clearer, while in Vietnam, the bigger the project, the greater the hurdles."" In Vietnam, it takes a startup three to six months to complete the legal formalities for a blockchain project, which means some could close down before even getting funding, he said. Huy said both businesses and investors face unnecessary legal risks since there are no laws governing blockchain. Trung said: ""Without a clear legal framework, startups always live in fear while operating. They have to be on the defensive thinking about how to comply with the law rather than spend that time on business and development."" Bringing them back Nguyen Ngoc Dung, an expert at the Ministry of Planning and Investment, said during the Vietnam Blockchain Expoverse in Dubai in March: ""I see that startups usually use Singapore for raising capital, then bring the money back to Vietnam for operating. I hope in the near future it becomes easier for firms to raise international funding."" Cris said: ""We cannot say that Vietnam is a startup nation or a technology leader if most projects are headquartered abroad. This could be considered a kind of brain drain."" Huy said Vietnam is not the only country without regulations on digital assets and cryptocurrencies, but it should have a basic legal framework to make the most of blockchainÅEEøΩEs potential.

Nguyen Thanh Trung, one of the founders of Axie Infinity, said that blockchain game has moved beyond the stage of discovering whether making something possible or not, to how good a creation can be. Pham Anh Tuan, a game developer with 10 years in the industry, said that blockchain games could remain popular for at least another 10-20 years. The blockchain industry is set to see the entrance of many traditional game giants, he said.

Nguyen Thien invested $4,000 to purchase monsters, known as Axies, in the game, hoping to recoup it within the month and begin making profits thereafter. In two weeks, however, he has only got back 25 percent of his investment. With six months of experience playing the game for someone else, Thien had made his own investment with three accounts using three separate devices. But the main cryptocurrency in the game, called Smooth Love Potion (SLP), has plunged nearly 43 percent since July 13 to $0.198, making it hugely difficult to get back his money, far less make a profit. ""ake less than $80 a day after spending all my time on the game. At this rate, it would take me two months of playing non-stop to get my money back."" Thien is one of 1.02 million players who have joined the play-to-earn game targeting profits. Axie Infinity, co-created by Vietnamese gamer and entrepreneur Nguyen Thanh Trung, now requires a player to invest $1,000-1,200 to build his or her starting team of three Axies and use them to battle others for rewards. A player uses the popular cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) to buy Axies but gets SLPs on winning. With the value of ETH doubling in the last three weeks and that of SLP falling, investors are not finding Axle Infinity a fun game anymore. ""I have spent nearly $1,500 on a standard team which cost less than $1,000 two weeks ago,"" said Vu Nguyen. ""I hope the SLP will rise again quickly, but this looks unlikely as it seems to be on a downward trend."" Another concern for players is the latest update from game operator Sky Mavis. On Monday, the amount of SLP a player gets from winning a battle with the computer was halved from 50 to 25. The reward for a battle between human players, however, was increased. Battling human players is considered more difficult. ""This means the operator is moving the game in a new direction to attract more real players instead of letting investors dominate the platform,"" said Thanh Vinh, admin of a Facebook group of Axie Infinity players with more than 50,000 players. Those who want to join the game only to make money will have to reconsider their move because of the cut in SLP rewards, he added. Vinh said the policy change was the right decision because it reduces inflation of the cryptocurrency, making the game more balanced for new players. Sky Mavis also explained its decision as a way to ensure the ""long-term health of the system"" as the amount of SLP created recently was many times more than the amount spent. Other players, however, consider this a negative move. Nguyen Manh, a game developer in HCMC, said that a play-to-earn game is a small economy, and developers should not interfere when there is a rise or fall in the cryptocurrency. He compared the mechanics of the game with how farmers produce their crops. The more crop farmers produce the lower their prices will be because of a glut, but this was a natural principle and the market would adjust this by itself. ""It is wrong for developers to cut the reward by half. It is similar to forcing farmers to produce only half of what they can. That is negative,"" Manh said. The changes will push a number of players leave the game, he said, adding that developers should have created new events for players to spend their SLP on to reduce inflation. Thinh, meanwhile, is considering changing his strategy to recover his investment faster. ""IÅEEøΩEll focus on one account to make them stronger and battle other players.""uyen, however, said he would stop playing after recouping his investment.

The 29-year-old used to see creators of blockchain projects taking advantage of initial coin offering events to raise money and then neglect developing the product. ""I thought that was unethical, and I hated everything about blockchain,"" he told VnExpress. Apart from being a game ""addict"" when he was small, Trung did not have much experience in the industry. In his second year of programming at the FPT University, 19-year-old Trung left school to become an entrepreneur and became the chief technology officer of food startup Lozi which has now become delivery company LoShip. After three years in the startup world, he returned to the university and finished his education. During that time he started to learn more about blockchain games. His research findings changed his mind. Trung realized that blockchain was only a technology, a tool, and whether it was good or band depended on how it was used. In 2017, he and two like-minded foreigners heÅEEøΩEd met while playing a blockchain game began to develop a game called Axie Infinity as a side project from their day jobs. Trung had been dissatisfied with the game they were playing and wanted to improve on it. The trio established a company called Sky Mavis the next year and started to rai""oney by letting users buy Axies, monsters used to combat others, to get rewards. After raising the first $500,000, Trung quit his job and prevailed upon the two cofounders from the U.S. and Norway to move to Vietnam and focus their entire energy on the project. Sky Mavis has since raised $7.5 million from several investors including American billionaire ""shark"" investor Mark Cuban. Trung said that in the early stage, overcoming the language and culture barrier with the other co-founders was one of the most difficult tasks. Aleksander Leonard Larsen, the Norwegian co-founder, did not even know where Vietnam was on the map at first, Trung said. But now both Larsen and the American co-founder Jeffrey Zirlin have become familiar driving the motorbike in HCMC and driving bargains while shopping at a market, he added. The risk the trio took and the hard work they put in has paid off. The Axie Infinity cryptocurrency (AXS), one of the cryptocurrencies used in the game, has a market cap of $2.5 billion now, up nine times from the beginning of the year. One of the most special features of Axie Infinity that explains its popularity is that it is a ""play to earn"" game, which means players are actually investors and can win or lose money. Players invest by buying Axies and making money by selling strong and rare ones. They can even ""breed"" new ones and sell them for profit. Trung and his team use the money from players to create even more Axies and content to attract more players and create more interaction. Axie Inifinity now has around 350,000 daily active users, with 40 percent of them in the Philippines, followed by Venezuela and the U.S. ""It (Axie Infinity) has sustained our daily needs, paid our bills, and debts,"" says a Filippino mother of three in the documentary ""Play-to-Earn"" released in May. ""I am thankful to Axie because somehow it helped us."" However, the developers of the game acknowledge that blockchain games are still young in the industry and new players can face difficulties in the early stages as they need to get familiar with cryptocurrency trading as well as invest around $1,200 to build a monster team. ""Our job is to resolve these challenges so people can access the game more easily,"" Trung said. Trung sees an industry redefining potential for Axie Infinity in the future.

Working with IBM, retail giant Wal-Mart Stores is testing the technology system on mangos in the United States and pork in China.

Blockchain, the underlying technology behind virtual currency bitcoin, is a digital system that allows counter parties to transact using individual codes for goods.

""I see a lot of potential to create what I call a digital and transparent food system,"" said Wal-Mart food safety vice president Frank Yiannas.

The technology enables different parties in the supply chain to share details such as the date an animal was slaughtered or the weather conditions at harvest time.

Data can be stored through a photograph on a smartphone that is transmitted onto a dedicated platform.

The system also can also counter fraud and mistaken deliveries, champions of the technology say.

""The advantage of blockchain is that the ledger is immediately updated and all the parties have access to the latest information,"" said Bill Fearnley, Jr. an expert at market intelligence firm IDC.

Supporters of blockchain are especially keen to address salmonella and other food safety problems that can cause health scares that weigh on corporate reputation and damage sales.

The technology allows a more efficient response if there is a problem, enabling companies to locate the source of an incident more quickly, Yiannas said.

He pointed to a 2006 case where it took hundreds of investigators and two weeks to identify the source of bad spinach under a paper-based system.

But blockchain ""reduces tracing from days to seconds,"" Yiannas said. ""The more accurately you can track food, the better.""

Demand for transparency

The other great virtue of blockchain is enhanced transparency by letting consumers look up key information on where food comes from, an asset amid growing concerns about genetically-modified crops and artificial ingredients.

That additional transparency also can help promote more desirable practices.

British online startup Provenance used blockchain technology to test tuna caught in Indonesia to help corroborate claims the fish were responsibly caught.

The technology also has been embraced by companies in the jewelry business to fight the sale of so-called ""conflict diamonds,"" which come from war-torn regions.

""Our goal is to provide transparency at every step of a diamond's journey and ultimately re-shape the way we trade diamonds globally,"" said Leanne Kemp chief executive of Everledger, a British company that tracks diamonds from the mines to jewelry stores.

But to completely function as a system, all the parties need to participate, Fearnley said.

Danish shipping giant Maersk estimates the technology could save billions of dollars by eliminating fraud and incorrect deliveries. It is testing the technology with container ships between Kenya and the Netherlands.

But the transition will require investment. A refrigerated product raised in Africa and shipped to Europe requires at least 30 people with some 200 interactions among parties, including customs, taxes, and food safety oversight.",World,Related to Blockchain,"Food safety, Techonology",VNExpress

In January, the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley will offer its first ever course in blockchain software. The Haas school, which is near San Francisco and Silicon Valley, will handpick 60 students from the departments of business, engineering and law and split them into groups of six to explore possible applications of the technology. ""When people think about blockchain they think about cryptocurrencies,"" said Haas school lecturer Greg LaBlanc, who sees the technology as potentially disrupting many sectors. ""We believe it will have the biggest impact on contracting, logistics and supply chains, healthcare, public administration, assets clearing, property, transactions,"" he said. ""Pretty much every function of businesses are going to be affected by this."" 'Very transformational' Blockchain runs by recording transactions as ""blocks"" that are updated in real time on a digitized ledger that can be read from anywhere and does not have a central recordkeeper. It was originally developed as the accounting method for bitcoin. But while that cryptocurrency remains controversial with some players in finance, bankers increasingly see exposure blockchain as a must. Blockchain is ""something we are very optimistic about,"" JPMorgan Chase chief financial officer Marianne Lake said on a conference call last month. Newer technologies could be ""very transformational for the financial services industry and we are forward-leaning and optimistic about that,"" Lake added. The technology, which lets users trace items back through their supply chains, also could offer a means to limit tainted food problems, or to guard against ""blood diamonds"" that come from a war-ravaged area. In finance, blockchain could be used to permit parties to check the solvency of counterparties, significantly reducing costs. Training students for that function and other evolving roles in finance is altering curricula at universities and shifting how students structure their programs. Students who wish to work in trading must learn how to code, while bankers need to understand algorithms and big data to be able to attract new clients and devise strategies for fast-changing markets. Traditional skills still required ""Anyone who is coming into the financial industry is expected to have some skills in technology,"" said Stephen Daffron, a founder of Motive Partners, a private equity firm specializing in fintech investment. ""If they don't understand how to evaluate a company that tries to employs blockchain, then they won't probably be a good fit for us,"" said Daffron, who lectures at the Yale School of Management. Barbara Hewitt, senior associate director in the career services office at the University of Pennsylvania, home to the Wharton School, also noted the rising interest in new skills and technology. ""I increasingly see students opting to explore technical minors, such as in computer science, to be well prepared for the growing use of technology in many fields,"" she said. But if exposure to fintech has become more important to hireability, traditional skills such as accounting, mathematics and understanding of economics remain the top criteria for recruiters, the schools say. Companies ""want people with strong technical skills, people with management skills,"" said Abigail Kies, assistant dean of career development at Yale. At Yale, about 20 percent of 2016 graduates found jobs in finance, according to figures supplied by the university. Fritz Foley, a finance professor at Harvard Business School said jobs in this sector still ""require strong analytical abilities, an understanding of institutional details, and good judgment.""
