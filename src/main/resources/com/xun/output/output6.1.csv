(Published 2022),2022-06-08T19:27:38.000Z,By The New York Times,null,"Cryptocurrencies have gone from a curiosity to a sizable force in finance, technology and culture, making them almost impossible to ignore. A range of players have embraced crypto, from individual speculators to major financial institutions, despite how volatile they are.. Some have generated vast riches, while others have destroyed huge amounts of wealth. When people talk about crypto, they may be referring to one of many different ideas and companies. The industry is booming and spawning an abundance of projects and new terms to go with them. The topic can be confusing, but the concept has also become ubiquitous. Learning the right terminology can help. Jump to: What is a Bitcoin? What is Bitcoin mining? What is a blockchain? What is Coinbase? What are cryptocurrencies? What is DeFi? What is an NFT? What is a stablecoin? What is web3? What is a Bitcoin? A Bitcoin is a digital token that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world. A Bitcoin can be divided out to eight decimal places, so you can send someone 0.00000001 Bitcoin. This smallest fraction of a Bitcoin ó the penny of the Bitcoin world ó is referred to as a Satoshi, named after the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is also the name of the payment network on which this form of digital currency is stored and moved. Unlike traditional payment networks such as Visa, the Bitcoin network is not run by a single company or person. The system is run by a decentralized network of computers around the world that keep track of all Bitcoin transactions, similar to the way Wikipedia is maintained by a decentralized network of writers and editors. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a creator who goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, who communicated with the rest of the world only by email and social messaging. While several people have been identified as possibly being Satoshi, the identity of the real Satoshi has not been confirmed. Satoshi created the original rules of the Bitcoin network and then shared the software with the rest of the world in 2009. The inventor largely disappeared from the public two years later. Once Satoshi had released the software, anyone could download and use it. This means Satoshi has no more control over the network now than anyone else. What is Bitcoin mining? Bitcoin mining refers to the process through which new Bitcoins are created and given to computers helping to maintain the network. The computers involved in Bitcoin mining are in a sort of computational race to process new transactions coming onto the network, solving complex math problems that require quintillions of numerical guesses per second. The winner of that race ó generally the person with the fastest computers ó gets a chunk of new Bitcoins. Since miners can earn rewards but are independent, this process is meant to incentivize participation and maintenance. There is generally a new winner about every 10 minutes, and this will continue until there are 21 million Bitcoins in the world. At that point, no new Bitcoins will be created. The network is expected to reach that cap in 2140. Every Bitcoin in existence was created through this method and initially given to a computer helping to maintain the records. In Bitcoinís early years, a crypto enthusiast could mine coins by running software on a laptop. But as the digital assets have become more popular, the amount of power necessary to win the race and generate Bitcoins has soared. A single Bitcoin transaction now requires more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, or enough energy to sustain the average U.S. household for 73 days, according to some estimates. ADVERTISEMENT SKIP ADVERTISEMENT What is a blockchain? A blockchain is a database that is maintained communally and that reliably stores digital information. The original blockchain was the database on which all Bitcoin transactions were stored. It was named ìblockchainî because the transactions coming onto the network were grouped into blocks of data and then chained together using sophisticated math. After the Bitcoin blockchain had operated for a number of years, successfully storing every Bitcoin transaction and surviving numerous attacks from hackers, many programmers and entrepreneurs wondered if its design could be replicated to create other kinds of secure ledgers unrelated to Bitcoin. Companies and governments that donít rely on currency have since begun using blockchain technology to store their data. Banks are building blockchains that can track payments between accounts, while governments are experimenting with using blockchains to store property records and votes. What is Coinbase? Coinbase is a platform that allows people and companies to buy and sell various digital currencies, including Bitcoin, for a transaction fee. It is similar to a stock exchange. Founded in San Francisco in 2012, Coinbase allows people and companies to buy and sell various digital currencies, including Bitcoin. In April 2021, Coinbase became the first major cryptocurrency company to list its shares on a U.S. stock exchange. Coinbase set itself apart from other early blockchain businesses by becoming one of the first to get a new special license, called the BitLicense, to run a virtual currency company in New York. In addition to providing the brokerage service for small investors, Coinbase also runs an exchange called GDAX, which is tailored to larger investors. What are cryptocurrencies? ìCryptocurrenciesî is a term referring to the various virtual currencies that have been developed since Bitcoin was created. The most well-known cryptocurrencies are Ether, Dogecoin and Tether. Ether is the virtual currency used on the global computing network Ethereum, which operates according to rules defined by Ethereum software. Those rules allow the Ethereum network to be programmed to complete certain types of computing tasks, with every computer on the network completing the tasks simultaneously to ensure they are done correctly. Generally, the tasks involve money. The creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, has likened the network to a global smartphone that can be programmed to operate according to the apps built on top of it. The apps are called Dapps because they are run by a decentralized network of computers. Mr. Buterin was inspired by Bitcoinís success to create Ethereum. But he set out to build something that could do more than Bitcoin: He wanted to build a system that would make it possible to program more complex financial transactions. With Ethereum, two companies can conduct transactions, such as settling a stock option on a shared computer, that allows them both to check the records. Dogecoin was created as a parody of cryptocurrency in 2013 by two friends who had met in a chat room. Named after a meme of an expressive dog, Dogecoin was meant to mock the self-serious cryptocurrencies of the time, many of which never took off. The joke did, though, and it spawned a community of enthusiasts who have kept it alive for years. Tether is the largest stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency that is typically pegged to an existing government-backed currency. It is roughly half-invested in a type of short-term corporate debt called commercial paper. Show more ADVERTISEMENT SKIP ADVERTISEMENT What is DeFi? Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, refers to the universe of alternative financial services spawned by the development of cryptocurrencies. DeFi is an umbrella term for the part of the crypto universe that is geared toward building a new, internet-native financial system, using blockchains to replace traditional intermediaries like banks and trust mechanisms. It has allowed crypto businesses to move into more traditional banking territory, offering services such as lending and borrowing. Investors can earn interest on their holdings of digital currencies ó often a lot more than they could on cash deposits in a bank ó or borrow with crypto as collateral to back a loan. Crypto loans generally involve no credit checks since transactions are backed by digital assets. To send or receive money in the traditional financial system, you need intermediaries like banks or stock exchanges. In DeFi, those middlemen are replaced by software. As people trade directly with one another, blockchain-based ìsmart contractsî do the work of making markets, settling trades and ensuring that the entire process is fair and trustworthy. What is an NFT? A nonfungible token, or NFT, is a digital asset that establishes authenticity and ownership and can be verified on a blockchain network. An NFT is basically a way to claim ownership of a digital file: You can think of it as a certificate of authenticity you might get if you buy an expensive sculpture. The sculpture can be copied, forged or even stolen, but because you have the certificate of authenticity, you can theoretically prove that you are the owner of the original. NFTs make digital artworks unique and, therefore, sellable. Artists, musicians, influencers and sports franchises can use them to monetize digital goods that were previously cheap or free. The technology also responds to the art worldís need for authentication and provenance in an increasingly digital world, permanently linking a digital file to its creator. The technology for NFTs has been around since the mid-2010s but became mainstream in late 2017 with CryptoKitties, a site that allowed people to buy and ìbreedî limited-edition digital cats with cryptocurrency. Since then, investors have begun buying and trading NFTs, often for eye-popping prices. What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is typically pegged to a stable asset, like the dollar or another government-backed currency. To promise holders that every $1 they put in will remain worth $1, stablecoin issuers hold a bundle of assets in reserve, usually short-term securities such as cash, government debt or commercial paper. Stablecoins are useful because they help lock in value at the time of transaction. This is important since cryptocurrencies are volatile and prone to price fluctuations. They form a bridge between traditional money and crypto, and are exploding in popularity as a practical and cheap way to make transactions in cryptocurrency. But many stablecoins are built more like slightly risky investments than like the dollars-and-cents cash they claim to be. And, so far, they are slipping through regulatory cracks. Regulators are concerned about stablecoins because they have exploded in popularity very quickly, and because many are backed by traditional reserves, they could and trigger a kind of bank run that would potentially pose risks in the wider financial system. There is also no consistent oversight of issuers or a standard for reserves, and as such different stablecoin issuers have different types of reserve backing, including more or less cash, treasuries, commercial paper, etc. There are a few kinds of stablecoins, including these digital assets backed by traditional reserves, others are collateralized by crypto and, finally, algorithmic stablecoins. The risk in algorithmic stablecoins ó which depend on a mathematical formula devised by issuers and investor interest to maintain stability ó was demonstrated in May when Terra/Luna crashed after the assumptions the algorithm was premised on did not pan out in the market and investors fled. ADVERTISEMENT SKIP ADVERTISEMENT What is web3? ìWeb3î is a term some technologists use to describe the idea of a new version of the web made up of blockchain-based platforms and services fueled by cryptocurrency. At its core, web3 aims to replace centralized corporate platforms with open protocols and decentralized, community-run networks. The term has been around for years, but it has become trendy in the past year or so. Packy McCormick, an investor who helped popularize web3, has defined it as ìthe internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens.î Web3 is seen as the next evolution of web1 (the era in the 1990s and early 2000s during which the internet was made up of blogs, message boards and early portals like AOL and CompuServe) and web2 (a phase starting around 2005 or so, characterized by social media behemoths like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube). Proponents envision that web3 will take many forms, including decentralized social networks, ìplay-to-earnî video games that reward players with crypto tokens, and NFT platforms that allow people to buy and sell pieces of digital culture. The more idealistic ones say web3 will transform the internet as we know it, upending traditional gatekeepers and ushering in a new, middleman-free digital economy. But some critics believe that web3 is little more than a rebranding effort for crypto, with the aim of shedding cryptoís reputation as a place for rogues and rebels and convincing people that blockchains are the next phase of computing. Others believe itís a dystopian vision of a pay-to-play internet in which every activity and social interaction becomes a financial instrument to be bought and sold.",Explain,Related to Blockchain

Queen Elizabeth II knighted him in 2004 for his achievement. I think it‚Äôs fair to say, though, that most people are not in the mood to celebrate what has become of Sir Timothy‚Äôs invention. It‚Äôs common to hear that the internet is broken and that social media is a dumpster fire. Recent case in point: On Wednesday the House voted to force the Chinese owners of TikTok to sell it, or be banned from the United States, on the grounds that it has become a channel for what the House majority leader called Chinese ‚Äúdata collection and propaganda.‚Äù Technology types are working on cures for what ails the internet, and their cures are, no surprise, technological. I‚Äôve been reading up on some of them. A lot go in the right direction, but I haven‚Äôt seen anything that seems likely to fully solve the many problems of today‚Äôs internet, from invasions of privacy to incitements of violence. That‚Äôs a tall order. Fortunately, a lot of smart people are taking the issues seriously. Lasting solutions, if there are any, are likely to come from a combination of technological, legal and cultural approaches. Back to the nerds: On Tuesday Berners-Lee published an open letter on Medium that said the web was intended ‚Äúto be a tool to empower humanity‚Äù that ‚Äúwas decentralized with a long tail of content and options.‚Äù In the past decade, though, he wrote, ‚Äúinstead of embodying these values, the web has instead played a part in eroding them.‚Äù Berners-Lee is developing and proselytizing for a new system that gives each person his or her own personal online-only data store, or POD for short. The PODs let people decide how their data is managed, used and shared. The Flanders region of Belgium has already authorized PODs for all of its citizens, Berners-Lee wrote. He co-founded a company, Inrupt, that‚Äôs built on the concept of PODs and the computer servers associated with them. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

4,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/01/opinion/blockchains-what-are-they-good-for.html,Opinion | Blockchains  What Are They Good For? - The New York Times,2022-12-02T00:00:09.000Z,By Paul Krugman,Growing evidence says: absolutely nothing. ,"A year ago Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were selling at record prices, with a combined market value of around $3 trillion; glossy ads featuring celebrities ‚Äî most infamously Matt Damon‚Äôs ‚ÄúFortune Favors the Brave‚Äù ‚Äî filled the airwaves. Politicians, including, alas, the mayor of New York, raced to align themselves with what seemed to be the coming thing. Skeptics like yours truly were told that we just didn‚Äôt get it. Since then the prices of crypto assets have plunged, while a growing number of crypto institutions have collapsed amid allegations of scandal. The implosion of FTX, which appears to have used depositors‚Äô money in an attempt to prop up a related trading firm, has made the most headlines, but it‚Äôs only one entry on a growing list. We are, many people say, going through a ‚Äúcrypto winter.‚Äù But that may understate the case. This is looking more and more like Fimbulwinter, the endless winter that, in Norse mythology, precedes the end of the world ‚Äî in this case the crypto world, not just cryptocurrencies but the whole idea of organizing economic life around the famous ‚Äúblockchain.‚Äù And the real question, it seems to me, is why so many people ‚Äî not just na√Øve small investors, but also major financial and business players ‚Äî bought into the belief that this bad idea was the wave of the future. A blockchain is a digital ledger associated with an asset, recording the history of transactions in that asset ‚Äî who bought it from whom and so on. The asset could be a digital token like a Bitcoin, but it could also be a stock or even a physical thing like a shipping container. Ledgers, of course, are nothing new. What‚Äôs distinctive about blockchains is that the ledgers are supposed to be decentralized: They aren‚Äôt sitting on the computers of a single bank or other company; they‚Äôre in the public domain, sustained by protocols that induce many people to maintain records on many servers. These protocols are, everyone tells me, extremely clever. I‚Äôll take their word for it. The question I‚Äôve never heard or seen satisfactorily answered, however, is, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù Why go to the trouble and expense of maintaining a ledger in many places, and basically carrying that ledger around every time a transaction takes place?

5,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/24/opinion/crypto-blockchain-nfts.html,Opinion | The Strange Allure of the Blockchain - The New York Times,2022-01-24T20:35:01.000Z,By Tressie McMillan Cottom,Why the appeal of cryptocurrencies and NFTs crosses borders of class and race.,"My family managed to get together for a small Thanksgiving dinner last year. It was our first gathering since April 2020. After a big meal, my cousin only wanted to talk about one thing: cryptocurrency. He is a middle-aged Black man from New York, just a few years older than I am, but those years make a huge difference in his job security. When he came of age, he got a blue-collar job working for the city. He has worked at that job since he was 17 years old, so he will be able to retire as a relatively young man. And since the job is unionized, my cousin will retire with a pension and health benefits ‚Äî the kind of pathway to economic security that is becoming increasingly rare. These days, ours is an information economy that likes credentials, which involves going to some kind of postsecondary school. Even with high wages for skilled trades, like the one my cousin used to get that union job straight after high school, blue-collar trades are a hard sell to young workers. My cousin is not exactly a dinosaur, but he is not the kind of guy you imagine day-trading or actively managing an investment portfolio. Yet he is absolutely enthused about Bitcoin. While he is figuring out his second act, he views crypto as the way to build ‚Äúgenerational wealth‚Äù and ‚Äúfreedom.‚Äù I put those words in quotes because you hear them a lot in conversations around financial-sector schemes, and I am not sure they mean anything in those contexts. This week, the New York mayor, Eric Adams, is living up to his campaign promise to get his first three paychecks converted to cryptocurrency. My blue-collar cousin has a lot in common with his mayor. The allure of the next American frontier crosses all kinds of lines, including class lines. I‚Äôll get to that in a second. Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, but there are many others, like Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Tether, which come up a lot among my peers. Some people talk about crypto as being revolutionary because it promises to democratize access to financial markets and give individual investors control of their destiny. In an adjacent space, nonfungible tokens ‚Äî or NFTs ‚Äî promise something similar. NFTs are like coupons that represent an underlying object, like a piece of artwork, although they could represent almost anything. For my part, the discussion over Thanksgiving leftovers brought home a data point about women‚Äôs and people of color‚Äôs interest in cryptocurrency. A 2021 survey found that the people who trade crypto are a far cry from the young, white, male image of a techbro: The average cryptocurrency trader is under 40 (mean age is 38) and does not have a college degree (55 percent). Two-fifths of crypto traders are not white (44 percent), and 41 percent are women. That survey captured a lot of people, like my cousin. What fascinates me is how widely crypto and NFT talk has diffused, and so quickly. It is not often that I hear the same branding from lower-income people of color that I also hear from high-earning white peers with advanced degrees. Depending on your consumer profile ‚Äî biographical data like your age, race and gender, plus your purchasing habits ‚Äî you probably hear about these financial instruments from online ads, social media groups, and peers who are early adopters. I hear about crypto from my educated, high-income academic and writing friends who also shop at Target a lot. I also hear about crypto from financial advisers and college classmates who share stories about making a lot of money mining crypto and trading NFTs. But because of my racial and geographic identities, I also hear about crypto from my working-class friends and family. They are getting messages about crypto from Facebook and Instagram and their friends who have moved on from candle-leggings-timeshare-jewelry multilevel marketing schemes to trading Dogecoin. Crypto and NFTs might be the only thing these diverse groups share in common. For that reason alone, the explosion of these technologies deserves some sociological attention.

You can sign up here to receive it weekdays. Maybe you‚Äôve read about the blockchain and don‚Äôt get the fuss. (I am sheepishly raising my hand.) Maybe you‚Äôve never heard of it. My colleague Nathaniel Popper will explain what you need to know and separate the blockchain hope from the hype. Nathaniel spoke to me about why some technologists can‚Äôt shut up about the blockchain and, in researching his latest article, what he found about how it might ‚Äî or might not! ‚Äî help people remodel the internet with less control by giants like Google and Facebook. Shira: I need this explained to me repeatedly. What is the blockchain? And how is it different from Bitcoin? Nathaniel: The blockchain in the simplest terms is a ledger ‚Äî a method of record keeping ‚Äî that was introduced to the public by Bitcoin, which is a cryptocurrency. Unlike conventional records kept by one bank or accountant, the blockchain ledger uses a bunch of computers that each add new entries visible to everyone. The blockchain design that Bitcoin inspired has been adapted for other kinds of records. The underlying principle is there is no central authority controlling a single ledger.

LVMH Mo√´t Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which first unveiled plans for a global blockchain-based system in 2019, will be joined by Prada Group and Compagnie Financi√®re Richemont in the Aura Blockchain Consortium, a nonprofit group that will promote the use of a single blockchain solution open to all luxury brands worldwide. Many sectors are looking at the possibility of using blockchain, the distributed ledger system that underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Because blockchains are unchangeable and decentralized, the data stored on them is trustworthy and secure. In this case, each product will be given a unique digital code during the manufacturing process that will be recorded on the Aura ledger. When customers make a purchase, they will be given login details to a platform that will provide the history of the product, including its origin, components, environmental and ethical information, proof of ownership, a warranty and care instructions. Bulgari, Cartier, Hublot, Louis Vuitton and Prada are already using the system, with ‚Äúadvanced conversations‚Äù being held with a number of other luxury brands, according to a statement released Tuesday. Participating luxury brands pay an annual licensing fee and a volume fee. Aura, based in Geneva, was developed in partnership with Microsoft and ConsenSys, a blockchain software technology company in New York. ‚ÄúThe Aura Consortium represents an unprecedented cooperation in the luxury industry,‚Äù said Cartier‚Äôs chief executive, Cyrille Vigneron, adding that he invited ‚Äúthe entire profession‚Äù to join the consortium. ‚ÄúThe luxury industry creates timeless pieces and must ensure that these rigorous standards will endure and remain in trustworthy hands,‚Äù he said.",Business,Related to Blockchain
10,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/opinion/crypto-terra-luna-blockchain.html,Opinion | Yes  Crypto Is Crashing Again. Blockchain Will Survive. - The New York Times,2022-06-16T09:00:18.000Z,By Maria Bustillos,Dont be distracted by the shenanigans going on in the casino. ,"This week, the crypto market plummeted for the second time in a month, in tandem with a sharp drop in global stock markets. The collapse, not the first of its kind, showed again how the violent swings of a largely unregulated market warp the development of a transformative technology. But crypto is just one aspect of the larger blockchain universe. Its skeptics and fans alike must learn to see it as a technological experiment, instead of just a blatant scam or a speculative path to riches. Why has the market fallen apart in such spectacular fashion? The first recent crash, when the cryptocurrency market plunged 36 percent in a week in May, offers a clue. The collapse was largely set off by the death spiral of a cryptocurrency system called Terra Luna, made up of the coin Luna and its associated stablecoin, TerraUSD. At its dizzying heights in the spring, it represented roughly 3 percent of the total crypto market. Fear spread throughout the exchanges, and with it came panic selling. After the second crash this week, the cryptocurrency market is still worth in total nearly $1 trillion (about one-third of last November‚Äôs peak). Only a few of the 19,000 cryptocurrencies that have been created since 2009 are now worth billions. Most have failed. The crypto market is wildly volatile not because of cryptocurrency‚Äôs underlying technology, but because of the uneasy and often dangerously unstable junction between emerging technologies and regular money. Viewed from the long perspective of market history, this instability isn‚Äôt remotely new. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, internet stocks were a white-knuckle ride, just as crypto is now. Back then, too, hucksterism was rampant, the atmosphere was like a casino, and almost any idea with an ‚Äúe‚Äù in front of it ‚Äî no matter how reckless or silly ‚Äî attracted attention from investors and the news media. Seemingly every day, fortunes were spectacularly made and lost. But even as Napster, Webvan and eToys flamed out, a revolution was taking place. Despite all the shenanigans going on in the casino, real and lasting companies, publications and communities were built and thrived online. The internet survived, more or less. Terraform Labs, the company behind TerraUSD and Luna, was founded in 2018 by Do Kwon, a computer scientist and entrepreneur in South Korea. Mr. Kwon, now 30, is a notoriously brazen hustler who has made waves for calling his critics ‚Äúpoor‚Äù and ‚Äúcockroaches.‚Äù But despite his lack of polish, and the early warnings from developers and analysts about the technical weaknesses of his plans, he succeeded in raising $200 million in venture capital from 2018 to 2021. His company boasted of reaching an elusive goal in crypto, namely, the establishment of a truly ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù stablecoin. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Atop the list are two races featuring the most endangered Democrats up for re-election, in Ohio and Montana. The crypto industry and its aligned super PACs, which entered 2024 with more than $80 million in the bank, are aiming to use their financial and political might both to elect allies and ultimately shape a favorable set of regulations in Congress. ‚ÄúHow do people understand that crypto is real ‚Äî that it‚Äôs a real issue?‚Äù said Kara Calvert, the head of U.S. policy at Coinbase, one of the largest crypto trading platforms. ‚ÄúWhen you have $85 million behind an issue, that‚Äôs pretty real.‚Äù Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for Fairshake, the biggest of a group of three new crypto super PACs, said the super PAC had made the decision to play in four Senate races this year: the Democratic primaries in Maryland and Michigan, as well as the general elections in Ohio, where Senator Sherrod Brown is up for re-election, and Montana, where Senator Jon Tester faces a serious challenge. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have the resources to affect races and the makeup of institutions at every level,‚Äù Mr. Vlasto said. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôll leverage those assets strategically to maximize their impact in order to build a sustainable, bipartisan crypto and blockchain coalition.‚Äù Mr. Brown and Mr. Tester are the only two incumbent Senate Democrats nationwide running in states that former President Donald J. Trump won in 2020, and Democrats must win both for the party to have any hope of maintaining their slim majority. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Dance,"Pushed by an advocacy group, Arkansas became the first state to shield noisy cryptocurrency operators from unhappy neighbors. A furious backlash has some lawmakers considering a statewide ban.","On a sweltering July evening, the din from thousands of computers mining for Bitcoins pierced the night. Nearby, Matt Brown, a member of the Arkansas legislature, monitored the noise alongside a local magistrate. As the two men investigated complaints about the operation, Mr. Brown said, a security guard for the mine loaded rounds into an AR-15-style assault rifle that had been stored in a car. ‚ÄúHe wanted to make sure that we knew he had his gun ‚Äî that we knew it was loaded,‚Äù Mr. Brown, a Republican, said in an interview. The Bitcoin outfit here, 45 minutes north of Little Rock, is one of three sites in Arkansas owned by a network of companies embroiled in tense disputes with residents, who say the noise generated by computers performing trillions of calculations per second ruins lives, lowers property values and drives away wildlife. Scores of the operations have popped up in recent years across the United States. When a mining computer lands on numbers that Bitcoin‚Äôs algorithm accepts, the payout is currently worth about a quarter-million dollars. The more computers an operation has, the better chance of earning the payout. The industry is often criticized for its vast energy use ‚Äî often a boon for the fossil-fuel industry ‚Äî and noise is a common complaint. Though some elected officials like Mr. Brown and other Bitcoin operators in Arkansas have voiced support for the beleaguered residents, a new state law has given the companies a significant leg up.

The charges, filed in three cases in federal court in Washington, outline a complex multiyear effort to launder cryptocurrency obtained by the Lazarus Group, an organization linked to espionage, online theft and cyberattacks, including the 2014 breach of Sony Pictures. The scheme involved a relatively modest amount of currency. But it represents only a fraction of the illegal activity being undertaken by North Korea, officials said ‚Äî and it vividly demonstrated the creativity and resolve of an isolated country intent on defying demands that it abandon its nuclear weapons and long-range missile programs. In the first indictment, the government charged a banker based in China, Sim Hyon Sop, 39, along with three cryptocurrency traders with conspiring to convert virtual currency that had been stolen from accounts into dollars. North Korea‚Äôs government, short on cash, later used the money to buy goods, including tobacco and communications equipment, in 2018. The second indictment outlined a related conspiracy by Mr. Sim, and various North Korean information technology workers who used fake identities to get jobs with blockchain companies in the United States. Several workers, and others not named in court papers, used that access to launder about $12 million that passed through Mr. Sim‚Äôs cryptocurrency wallet, prosecutors said. A third indictment describes an unlicensed money-transmitting business that conducted over 1,500 trades for U.S. customers without the necessary licenses.

Initial sales hint at how difficult that will be in 2023.","When Donald J. Trump announced his foray into NFTs late last year, capitalizing on public interest in his presidential campaign to sell cartoonish virtual trading cards depicting him as a superhero, he was derided for retreating to his huckster impulses. Anyone seeking insight into Mr. Trump‚Äôs decision need look no further than his partner in the enterprise. The online trading cards are the brainchild of Bill Zanker, a serial entrepreneur who has sold back rubs, gym equipment, self-help courses and, at times, Donald Trump himself. Before Mr. Trump‚Äôs political rise, Mr. Zanker co-wrote a book with him, teamed up in a crowdfunding business and, for several years, made Mr. Trump the centerpiece of a real estate road show that sold out sports arenas. Mr. Zanker once boasted in ads of paying Mr. Trump $25,000 a minute to speak. Times have changed for both men. Mr. Zanker‚Äôs best-known business, a for-profit education company called the Learning Annex, has gone dark, and a recent foray into fitness equipment hasn‚Äôt taken off. Mr. Trump, who is facing several investigations into his conduct, including his attempts to overturn a fair election, has become far less a symbol of American prosperity than of the nation‚Äôs polarizing politics. In business together again for the first time in more than seven years, the two are seeking to resuscitate a once-dependable formula blending celebrity with unabashed hype. Early sales results hint at just how difficult that project really is. Mr. Zanker first approached the former president with the idea last year, telling him that the enterprise could bring in as much as $100 million, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions who asked for anonymity to reveal private conversations. In exchange for licensing his name and likeness, Mr. Trump would receive a significant portion of any revenues from sales of what would become known as Trump Cards.

Hundreds of thousands of ballots for Clark County, which encompasses Las Vegas, are processed, sorted and counted here, against a backdrop of mountains and desert. Because elections in America are more fraught than ever, the scrutiny of ballot counting now starts well before Election Day, and the legal challenges have already begun. The Republican Party and allied groups, many seized by Donald J. Trump‚Äôs falsehoods about fraud in elections, are training monitors around the country to spot what they see as irregularities at absentee ballot counting centers. The monitors are told to take copious notes, which could be useful for potential court challenges, raising the prospect of a replay in state and local elections of Mr. Trump‚Äôs attempt to use the courts to overturn his loss two years ago. The activity has not produced reports of major disruptions or problems. But on Thursday, local officials were taking no chances at the vote counting center in Clark County: For almost every observer, the elections office had an ‚Äúambassador‚Äù to escort and observe the observers. Suspicions ran high. ‚ÄúWhat are those boxes for?‚Äù an older woman in a red coat inquired, pointing to a couple of empty bins. She was sitting behind a glass barrier encircling a cavernous vote tabulation area that had been transformed into a large fishbowl. A county official assured her that he would check; he later said they were used to store damaged ballots. Then she asked why county workers were allowed to bring in bags, fretting that they could be used to smuggle ballots, and was told they were most likely used by the staff to carry in their lunches. Another observer wanted to know what was written on some blue sticky notes that were too far away to read. (They are used to alphabetize unopened ballots.) And a third, a 61-year-old dental hygienist named Caryl Tunison, asked, ‚ÄúWhy do you not have cameras in every area here?‚Äù while she paused from writing in a notebook on her lap. She was sitting face to face with a young woman about three yards away, a county worker who sat on the other side of a glass partition and was placing envelopes in a bin.

Many lawmakers have been willing partners.","TALLAHASSEE, Fla. ‚Äî The debate took less than four minutes. In the Florida House last month, legislators swiftly gave final approval to a bill that makes it easier to buy and sell cryptocurrency, eliminating a threat from a law intended to curb money laundering. One of the few pauses in the action came when two House members stood up to thank crypto industry ‚Äústakeholders‚Äù for teaming with state officials to write a draft of the bill. ‚ÄúWhether you‚Äôre Binance or Ethereum, Dogecoin or Bitcoin, this is a great bill,‚Äù said Representative John Snyder, a Palm City Republican, referring to crypto exchanges and coins. Shortly afterward, the House voted unanimously to pass the measure. The Senate followed, sending the bill to Gov. Ron DeSantis for his signature after 75 seconds of deliberations. Florida‚Äôs warm embrace of the cryptocurrency agenda is just the tip of an aggressive industry-led push to position states as crypto-friendly beachheads. Across the nation, crypto executives and lobbyists are helping to draft bills to benefit the fast-growing industry, then pushing lawmakers to adopt these made-to-order laws, before moving rapidly to profit from the legislative victories. The effort is part of an emerging national strategy by the crypto industry, in the absence so far of comprehensive federal regulatory demands, to work state by state to engineer a more friendly legal system. Lobbyists are aiming to clear the way for the continued explosive growth of cryptocurrency companies, which are trying to revolutionize banking, e-commerce and even art and music. Many states are racing to satisfy the wish lists from crypto companies and their lobbyists, betting that the industry can generate new jobs. But some consumer advocates worry that this aim-to-please effort could leave investors and businesses more vulnerable to the scams and risky practices that have plagued crypto‚Äôs early growth.

The order, under development for months, will coordinate efforts among financial regulators to better understand the risks and opportunities presented by digital assets, particularly in the areas of consumer protection, national security and illicit finance. The move, according to the Biden administration, is a response to the ‚Äúexplosive growth‚Äù in digital assets, the increasing number of countries exploring central bank digital currencies and a desire to maintain American technological leadership. It directs financial regulators to continue with work that began in earnest last year, including studying and reporting on the creation of a digital dollar. The results could help shape the contours of a rapidly innovating industry that has swiftly moved into the mainstream but that critics say enables illicit activity, including money laundering, and creates outsize financial risks for consumers and the financial system. Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, and Jake Sullivan, the president‚Äôs national security adviser, said in a statement that the order ‚Äúwill help position the U.S. to keep playing a leading role in the innovation and governance of the digital assets ecosystem at home and abroad, in a way that protects consumers, is consistent with our democratic values and advances U.S. global competitiveness.‚Äù The directive calls on the government to assess the potential to develop a central bank digital currency ‚Äî essentially a digital dollar ‚Äî that would be used to modernize payment systems.

Or that‚Äôs the theory. Making it work has been much messier.,"WASHINGTON ‚Äî American CryptoFed is a new kind of company spawned by the advent of cryptocurrency ‚Äî one that claims, in a way, not to be a company at all. There are no owners, officers or employees, according to its stated plan. Instead, American CryptoFed is a ‚Äúdecentralized autonomous organization‚Äù that is supposed to be steered automatically by computer code and governed by a community of users who vote on proposals with crypto tokens. To their proponents, these types of ventures, known as DAOs, are a new model for commerce, one that could democratize business enterprises and break the hold that Big Tech and other entrenched middlemen have over innovation in the information age. Already, a rapidly growing number of these upstart organizations have emerged online, including financial services operations, news hubs and social clubs. But they are also coming under fire from multiple angles, reflecting both the disruptive force of the crypto phenomenon and the struggle to prove its practical use beyond financial speculation. Members of DAOs are clashing with one another about how to balance the need for skilled and experienced managers against the idealistic vision of communal decision-making. In some cases, crypto investors and regulators say, the ventures amount to Ponzi schemes intended to do little more than bolster the value of the digital tokens they sell. And regulators are swooping in amid concern about how to protect investors in organizations that do not adopt traditional business and accounting practices.

The reasons include a longstanding industry practice of aggregating rough diamonds from different mines, the number of intermediaries involved in transforming a raw stone into a cut and polished gem, and the fragmented and global nature of the trade itself. An equally powerful reason may be that neither the jewelry industry nor consumers prioritized it. ‚ÄúEverything was sold based on size and quality; it was never sold based on origin,‚Äù said Susan Jacques, the president and chief executive of the Gemological Institute of America (G.I.A.), headquartered in Carlsbad, Calif. Now, primarily because of the war in Ukraine and the additional sanctions expected soon on diamonds from Russia (the world‚Äôs biggest diamond exporter by volume), ‚Äúknowing where a diamond has come from is becoming essential information,‚Äù Al Cook, the chief executive of the De Beers Group, told an audience at a jewelry trade show in June in Las Vegas.

Russia is the world‚Äôs biggest diamond exporter by volume, with a state-owned company, Alrosa, mining almost one third of all diamonds produced in 2021. To prevent funds from flowing into the Kremlin war chest, the United States ‚Äî the world‚Äôs largest market for finished diamonds ‚Äî took action last spring when President Biden banned the import of rough diamonds from Russia and the U.S. Treasury Department placed sanctions on Alrosa. Other countries imposed sanctions of their own, including Britain, which early this year announced an outright ban on Russian diamonds. Last year the European Union had tried several times to enforce sanctions on Russian diamonds, but was prevented by Belgium because of protests from Antwerp, the Belgian port city that is a leading trade hub for precious stones. Its representatives have expressed concerns that, aside from the difficulty that comes with tracking a diamond‚Äôs true origin, sanctions could hand Antwerp‚Äôs rivals, like Dubai and India, a competitive advantage on the Russian diamond trade.

Lives in the Watch World‚Äôs Shadows - The New York Times,2023-06-15T09:12:14.193Z,By Victoria Gomelsky,"A few brands concede that they use chatbots to generate social media posts and mood boards, but for the most part their use remains ‚Äúin the shadows.‚Äù","GENEVA ‚Äî At IWC Schaffhausen‚Äôs booth at the Watches and Wonders fair in the convention center here this spring, Maurice Moitroux, IWC‚Äôs associate director of brand marketing, gestured toward a large, clunky, beige device sitting atop a counter near the entrance. ‚ÄúIt looks like a microwave, but it‚Äôs actually a computer,‚Äù he said. Intended to conjure the retro-futuristic vibe of IWC‚Äôs new Ingenieur watch collection ‚Äî an update to a 1976 model famously designed by Gerald Genta ‚Äî the vintage NCR monitor, dating to the 1980s, was one of several period artifacts displayed in and around the booth, including an experimental Mercedes-Benz C 111-III car from the 1970s. The computer, however, contained something unexpected: a ChatGPT 3.5-series module connected to a voice-activated application built to answer questions about Mr. Genta, who died in 2011, leaving behind a well-documented horological legacy. The display was an apt metaphor for the luxury watch industry‚Äôs current relationship with artificial intelligence. On the surface, A.I. is still something of a non-starter, with few brand executives being willing to discuss it publicly.

The reasons include a longstanding industry practice of aggregating rough diamonds from different mines, the number of intermediaries involved in transforming a raw stone into a cut and polished gem, and the fragmented and global nature of the trade itself. An equally powerful reason may be that neither the jewelry industry nor consumers prioritized it. ‚ÄúEverything was sold based on size and quality; it was never sold based on origin,‚Äù said Susan Jacques, the president and chief executive of the Gemological Institute of America (G.I.A.), headquartered in Carlsbad, Calif. Now, primarily because of the war in Ukraine and the additional sanctions expected soon on diamonds from Russia (the world‚Äôs biggest diamond exporter by volume), ‚Äúknowing where a diamond has come from is becoming essential information,‚Äù Al Cook, the chief executive of the De Beers Group, told an audience at a jewelry trade show in June in Las Vegas.

Known for its disruptive timekeeping technology that mixes liquid and mechanics, HYT ‚Äî for Hydro Mechanical Horologists ‚Äî burst onto the scene in 2012. Orders of more than 21 million Swiss francs, or $23.3 million, were quickly placed, but then came years of quality issues before a short-lived revival, followed by a bankruptcy in 2021. A second rebirth was equally brief, scuppered by a newly appointed chief executive who left after only 13 months. HYT‚Äôs current executive chairman, Vincent Perriard, who was its chief executive from 2011 to 2016, is now back running the show ‚Äî and trying to calm the waters. ‚ÄúTo be fully transparent, this company has been difficult from Day 1,‚Äù Mr. Perriard said at HYT‚Äôs headquarters in the Swiss watchmaking town of Neuch√¢tel. ‚ÄúBut there is a famous saying: ‚ÄòThere is no innovation and creativity without failure.‚Äô That‚Äôs really true.

Russia is the world‚Äôs biggest diamond exporter by volume, with a state-owned company, Alrosa, mining almost one third of all diamonds produced in 2021. To prevent funds from flowing into the Kremlin war chest, the United States ‚Äî the world‚Äôs largest market for finished diamonds ‚Äî took action last spring when President Biden banned the import of rough diamonds from Russia and the U.S. Treasury Department placed sanctions on Alrosa. Other countries imposed sanctions of their own, including Britain, which early this year announced an outright ban on Russian diamonds. Last year the European Union had tried several times to enforce sanctions on Russian diamonds, but was prevented by Belgium because of protests from Antwerp, the Belgian port city that is a leading trade hub for precious stones. Its representatives have expressed concerns that, aside from the difficulty that comes with tracking a diamond‚Äôs true origin, sanctions could hand Antwerp‚Äôs rivals, like Dubai and India, a competitive advantage on the Russian diamond trade. Not everyone agreed. ‚ÄúThere are people for whom the diamonds sold in Antwerp are more important than the battle we are waging,‚Äù President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said last year.

Intended to conjure the retro-futuristic vibe of IWC‚Äôs new Ingenieur watch collection ‚Äî an update to a 1976 model famously designed by Gerald Genta ‚Äî the vintage NCR monitor, dating to the 1980s, was one of several period artifacts displayed in and around the booth, including an experimental Mercedes-Benz C 111-III car from the 1970s. The computer, however, contained something unexpected: a ChatGPT 3.5-series module connected to a voice-activated application built to answer questions about Mr. Genta, who died in 2011, leaving behind a well-documented horological legacy. The display was an apt metaphor for the luxury watch industry‚Äôs current relationship with artificial intelligence.

But that sci-fi premise is little more than a veneer. Not for nothing did Mary Shelley give ‚ÄúFrankenstein‚Äù the subtitle ‚ÄúThe Modern Prometheus‚Äù; the finest genre fiction has always examined humanity through allegory. So, too, does van der Aa‚Äôs spare yet richly complicated work, which is preoccupied less with futuristic speculation than timeless matters of the heart and mind, whether corporeal or in the cloud. Which is not to say that van der Aa is uninterested in the bleeding edge. Rather, for decades, and with mixed success, he has been at the fore of marrying traditional forms with new media ‚Äî inventing software and putting his film degree to regular use ‚Äî through, for example, 3-D technology in the opera ‚ÄúSunken Garden‚Äù and virtual reality in the poetic installation ‚ÄúEight.‚Äù The challenge, always, is in making sure the shiny new thing doesn‚Äôt overtake the music, but instead is gracefully incorporated into a balanced whole. Van der Aa achieved something like that in ‚ÄúEight,‚Äù complementing the immersion of VR with a score of poplike directness. And ‚ÄúUpload‚Äù is the work of an artist in absolute command of his toolkit, employing a restraint that makes for smooth shifts between acoustic and electric, live performance and film, without any one thing drawing attention to itself throughout the opera‚Äôs brisk 80 minutes.

The legal battle had become part of a larger effort to define rules of ownership for digital artworks. A Canadian company named Free Holdings brought the complaint last year against the auction house and the artist, Kevin McCoy, who created the artwork in 2014 as a demonstration of the blockchain‚Äôs potential to register artworks on a digital ledger system. The artwork itself looks like something from a science-fiction movie, as if it were an alien wormhole pulsing with neon colors. The dispute arose because the blockchain system that McCoy used for ‚ÄúQuantum‚Äù also required him to periodically renew his ownership rights. (Most web domains operate by similar rules.) But the artist neglected to renew terms of ownership, which allowed Free Holdings to purchase the registration and assert ownership over the work itself. The company subsequently accused Sotheby‚Äôs and McCoy of slander and commercial disparagement. James Cott, a magistrate judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, dismissed the case and wrote that Free Holdings had failed to establish its claims of ownership and injury. ‚ÄúFree Holdings has demonstrated nothing more than an attempt to exploit open questions of ownership in the still-developing NFT field to lay claim to the profits of a legitimate artist,‚Äù Judge Cott said in his dismissal. William Charron, an attorney representing McCoy, said in an email that he believed the judge‚Äôs decision would clear some confusion in the market. ‚ÄúThe significance of this case is that it prevented a party from using somewhat obscure blockchain usage rules to appropriate the work-product of an artist,‚Äù Charron explained.

As prices soar to new levels and digital technology opens new markets, that talk is getting louder. Last month in London, DACS, Britain‚Äôs leading artists‚Äô rights management organization, unveiled ‚ÄúThe Art Market 2.0‚Äù to lawmakers in the House of Commons. A report by academics at the Alan Turing Institute in London and Oxford University, it envisioned how blockchain technology might ‚Äúchange the balance of economic power in the art market‚Äù and ‚Äúintegrate art into the financial sector.‚Äù A financialized Art Market 2.0 would lead to an ‚Äúexplosion of liquidity and value,‚Äù according to the report. A day later at the London Business School‚Äôs 10th Art Investment Conference, held at Phillips auction house, there were, as usual, sessions discussing the performance of art as a financial asset class.

Previous efforts to address this over the years have failed. But now, as musicians and other creative producers assert more control over their future sales and blockchain technology has allowed for easier tracking of intellectual property, two Stanford alumni have started a business to help visual artists reap the financial rewards when their work is resold privately or comes up for auction, in some cases at many multiples of the original price. ‚ÄúThere has been exponential growth in the secondary market, but artists have largely been left behind, even though they are essential to it,‚Äù Max Kendrick, one of the founders, said. ‚ÄúHow do we create a more sustainable model for the artist and the galleries that support them?‚Äù Charlie Jarvis, 24, a computer scientist, and Kendrick, 36, a former diplomat and a son of the sculptor Mel Kendrick, started the company, called Fairchain, in 2019. Little by little, it is gaining traction with artists and gallerists. ‚ÄúIf widely adopted, as it should be, it could be pretty revolutionary,‚Äù said the artist Hank Willis Thomas, an adviser to the company. ‚ÄúSo many artists who died poor spent their whole career giving away what they produced. ‚ÄúIn the music industry, it‚Äôs expected,‚Äù Thomas added. ‚ÄúI have friends on ‚ÄòLaw and Order‚Äô who, after 20 years, are still getting royalty checks.

Art Made With a Paintbrush - The New York Times,2022-02-12T10:00:22.000Z,By Zachary Small,"Now crypto collectors are investing in something more tangible, and traditional, like paintings and sculpture. And art dealers are rushing to woo them.","Felix Xu started his NFT art collection by purchasing a Chromie Squiggle, generated by an algorithm. Today, Xu, a 29-year-old Chinese tech executive, has more than 3,000 blockchain-based collectibles. But there is a hole burning in his crypto wallet that he would like to fill with real paintings. His budget stretches toward $500,000 and he is already on the wait-list for in-demand artists who use paint and moving brushes like Zhang Zipiao. So in December, Xu, a founder and chief executive of the start-ups Arpa and Bella Protocol, ventured through the gallery booths of Art Basel Miami Beach, where dealers from David Zwirner and Pace Gallery tried bending his ear toward the contemporary art market. He was looking for an education; they were looking for a sale. ‚ÄúI was really amazed with all the sculptures and paintings,‚Äù Xu said in an interview, crediting the fair with expanding his interest from blue-chip modernists like Picasso toward living artists like Nigel Cooke and Jessie Makinson. Xu is among the increasing number of NFT collectors looking to invest their cryptocurrency in something tangible: a traditional art collection, starting with the painting he bought in January by Renqian Yang, a Chinese artist living in New York. Critics have scoffed that a marriage between NFTs and the art world is impossible. But catering to the tastes of the crypto nouveau riche has become the frantic obsession of the commercial art world, which is reshaping itself around these new collectors nearly a year after artists like Beeple and Pak sold NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, for tens of millions of dollars, inspiring the typically technophobic art industry to head into the metaverse.

Boston and others are selling them to reach new audiences ‚Äúin a world where Instagram and Siri are prevalent.‚Äù","In July 2021, a portrait of a woman with frumpy hair, purple lipstick and a mole on her right cheek entered the collections of Miami‚Äôs Institute of Contemporary Art. The work was not a centuries-old oil on canvas. It did not once hang on a wall. The artwork was a nonfungible token, or NFT ‚Äî one of 10,000 unique, algorithm-generated 24-by-24 pixel digital images ‚Äî created in 2017 by the Larva Labs collective. ‚ÄúCryptoPunk 5293‚Äù (the work‚Äôs title) is part of the CryptoPunks series, which, in just five years, has racked up about $800 million worth of sales on the Ethereum blockchain exchange, according to its website. By acquiring the work last year (as a gift from a trustee), ICA Miami became one of the first museums to collect NFTs. And it has added two more NFTs this year. Other museums are also acquiring NFTs. Others, like the Uffizi Galleries in Florence, Italy, and the British Museum, are minting and selling them from works in their collections. And artists are being encouraged in their efforts to produce digital art. But even as museums dabble in NFTs, the market for them, and for the cryptocurrencies that they are traded in, has plummeted. Trading volumes are down 97 percent from peaks reached in January. In the latest sign of the market‚Äôs distress, the FTX cryptocurrency exchange filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, inflicting billions of dollars in losses on its clients and investors. So why is ICA Miami collecting NFTs? ‚ÄúOur collection, as well as our exhibitions and programs, seek to take on some of the most pressing and topical art and ideas that are happening today,‚Äù said Alex Gartenfeld, ICA Miami‚Äôs artistic director. ‚ÄúOver the last two or three years, one of the most ubiquitous and transformative conversations has been around how artists explore and develop their creativity through NFTs.‚Äù He said that digital art had a long history and that, while it found itself now ‚Äúat the center of the marketplace‚Äù and public attention, it was not that way for the preceding three decades. In any event, he added, museums are not concerned with the value of their art collections so ‚Äúthe groupthink is fairly irrelevant to the work that we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

The argument that NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, represented the art market‚Äôs future was unappealing to the bulk of these buyers, leaving gallerists and auctioneers to focus their attention on a new class of millennial connoisseurs from the tech world. The arrangement left auction houses prioritizing Pak cubes and Bored Apes ‚Äî collectibles that are the closest one can get to brand-names in the crypto world ‚Äî in sales that further alienated the skeptics. But one year later, Sotheby‚Äôs has started using the more genteel language of art history to entice traditional collectors toward blockchain-based collectibles for a sale, Natively Digital NFT. It is running April 18-25 and is designed to unite early pioneers of computer art with their crypto counterparts. Traditional collectors are often drawn to provenance and pedigree, so a sale focused on the lineage of computer art might help convince them that NFT artists have a stronger art historical foundation beyond the beep and boop of internet forums. The event features some of the earliest examples of generative art, a genre where control of the creative process is determined by algorithms or a predetermined process to create images. Examples include artists working in the 1960s and 1970s like Vera Molnar, Chuck Csuri and Roman Verostko alongside more recent offerings from the digital artists Dmitri Cherniak, Tyler Hobbs and Anna Ridler.

Has it Changed Art? - The New York Times,2022-03-03T16:32:39.000Z,By Blake Gopnik,Hardly at all.,"Around 1425, the Florentine artist Masaccio painted the first major works in one-point perspective. That revolutionized what artists could do ever after. In Paris in 1839, Louis-Jacques-Mand√© Daguerre demonstrated his new photographic invention. It changed the nature of visual representation and museum walls haven‚Äôt been the same since. On March 11, 2021, all of one year ago, Mike Winkelmann, whose nom d‚Äôartiste is Beeple, sold a collage of computer illustrations for $69 million simply because that collage came attached to a digital certificate called an NFT. That colossal price launched a mad scramble among creators of all kinds ‚Äî illustrators, musicians, photographers, even a few veteran avant-gardists ‚Äî to join the NFT gold rush. In the 12 months since, something like $44 billion has been spent on about six million NFTs, usually issued to certify digital creations but sometimes for physical objects like paintings and sculptures. But did this vast tsunami of ‚ÄúNFT art‚Äù actually trigger any kind of sea change in what art looks like, what it means or what, in some profound sense, it is? Hardly at all, and there‚Äôs a chance such a change might barely be possible: That‚Äôs because ‚ÄúNFT art‚Äù simply does not exist.

The market for tulips collapsed later that month, with prices of more common bulbs falling by as much as 95 percent. Since then, tulip mania has become a byword for the irrationality of financial bubbles. So what about NFT mania? Last week, Nifty Gateway, a specialist online marketplace for nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, held an auction that included a computer-generated illustration by the digital artist Mike Winkelmann, known as Beeple, whose JPG collage ‚ÄúEverydays ‚Äî The First 5000 Days‚Äù was sold online by Christie‚Äôs earlier this month for a sensational $69.3 million.

That could have bought a three-bedroom, three-bathroom apartment overlooking Central Park in New York. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a frenzy of speculation. I don‚Äôt know how long these prices will be sustainable,‚Äù said Robert Norton, the chief executive and co-founder of Verisart, a company that certifies artworks on the blockchain. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre living in a moment of collective hysteria.‚Äù We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

10,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/arts/design/christies-beeple-nft.html,Who Is Beeple? The Digital Artist Who Brought Crypto to Christie‚Äôs. - The New York Times,2021-02-24T23:53:35.000Z,By Josie Thaddeus-Johns,The artist‚Äôs brash riffs on the news have whipped up a frenzy of interest within the cryptocurrency scene.,"Mike Winkelmann never used to call himself an artist. But that was before he made $3.5 million in a single weekend from selling his artworks. In December, he auctioned off multiple editions of three digital artworks, each priced at $969, and 21 unique works, most of which sold for about $100,000 each. It was only the second time he had put his art on sale. The digital artist, who goes by Beeple, has created a drawing every single day for the last 13 years. He started with pen and paper but now mostly uses computer software such as the program Cinema 4D. On Thursday, a two-week-long online auction of a composite of the first 5,000 days of the project will begin at Christie‚Äôs, which says it‚Äôs the auction house‚Äôs first sale of a solely digital artwork. It will also be the first time that Christie‚Äôs will accept payment in the cryptocurrency Ether. Beeple is selling these works as NFTs ‚Äî nonfungible tokens ‚Äî digital collectibles that use blockchain technology as authentication. An NFT can take any form, but for Beeple, it usually consists of an image or video file, sometimes with a physical object attached, verified with a digital signature on a blockchain. NFTs cleverly respond to the art world‚Äôs need for authentication and provenance in an increasingly digital world, permanently linking a digital file to its creator. It makes digital artworks unique, and therefore, sellable. The speculative market for NFTs has skyrocketed in the last 12 months, and continues to grow. According to the NFT Report 2020, published by L‚ÄôAtelier BNP Paribas and Nonfungible.com, the value of the NFT market tripled in 2020, putting its current value over $250 million. Now, the same investors who speculate on cryptocurrencies are trading wildly increasing volumes of NFTs on websites such as MakersPlace (which is partnering with Christie‚Äôs for the Beeple sale), SuperRare, and Rarible, where recent transactions are front and center. Memes and graphic collectibles are sold alongside artworks like Beeple‚Äôs, blurring the line between them. Image A detail from the work.

NFTs make it possible to collect his digital art in a similar way to paintings, sculptures or conceptual pieces.Credit...via Christie's Images Ltd. Although it‚Äôs the first time that Christie‚Äôs will sell a purely virtual work, the art world is familiar with this genre of sale. To take one example, anyone could duct tape a banana to the wall, but it wouldn‚Äôt be Maurizio Cattelan‚Äôs ‚ÄúComedian.‚Äù Likewise, someone could easily make a digital copy of Beeple‚Äôs ‚ÄúEverydays ‚Äî The First 5000 Days,‚Äù but even though the content would be exactly the same, they wouldn‚Äôt own the artwork itself without blockchain verification.

The legal battle had become part of a larger effort to define rules of ownership for digital artworks. A Canadian company named Free Holdings brought the complaint last year against the auction house and the artist, Kevin McCoy, who created the artwork in 2014 as a demonstration of the blockchain‚Äôs potential to register artworks on a digital ledger system. The artwork itself looks like something from a science-fiction movie, as if it were an alien wormhole pulsing with neon colors. The dispute arose because the blockchain system that McCoy used for ‚ÄúQuantum‚Äù also required him to periodically renew his ownership rights. (Most web domains operate by similar rules.) But the artist neglected to renew terms of ownership, which allowed Free Holdings to purchase the registration and assert ownership over the work itself. The company subsequently accused Sotheby‚Äôs and McCoy of slander and commercial disparagement. James Cott, a magistrate judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, dismissed the case and wrote that Free Holdings had failed to establish its claims of ownership and injury. ‚ÄúFree Holdings has demonstrated nothing more than an attempt to exploit open questions of ownership in the still-developing NFT field to lay claim to the profits of a legitimate artist,‚Äù Judge Cott said in his dismissal. William Charron, an attorney representing McCoy, said in an email that he believed the judge‚Äôs decision would clear some confusion in the market. ‚ÄúThe significance of this case is that it prevented a party from using somewhat obscure blockchain usage rules to appropriate the work-product of an artist,‚Äù Charron explained.

2,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/arts/design/nfts-museums.html,NFTs  on the Decline Elsewhere  Are Embraced by Some Museums - The New York Times,2022-11-30T10:02:57.000Z,By Farah Nayeri,"ICA Miami owns a few, and M.F.A. Boston and others are selling them to reach new audiences ‚Äúin a world where Instagram and Siri are prevalent.‚Äù","In July 2021, a portrait of a woman with frumpy hair, purple lipstick and a mole on her right cheek entered the collections of Miami‚Äôs Institute of Contemporary Art. The work was not a centuries-old oil on canvas. It did not once hang on a wall. The artwork was a nonfungible token, or NFT ‚Äî one of 10,000 unique, algorithm-generated 24-by-24 pixel digital images ‚Äî created in 2017 by the Larva Labs collective. ‚ÄúCryptoPunk 5293‚Äù (the work‚Äôs title) is part of the CryptoPunks series, which, in just five years, has racked up about $800 million worth of sales on the Ethereum blockchain exchange, according to its website. By acquiring the work last year (as a gift from a trustee), ICA Miami became one of the first museums to collect NFTs. And it has added two more NFTs this year. Other museums are also acquiring NFTs. Others, like the Uffizi Galleries in Florence, Italy, and the British Museum, are minting and selling them from works in their collections. And artists are being encouraged in their efforts to produce digital art. But even as museums dabble in NFTs, the market for them, and for the cryptocurrencies that they are traded in, has plummeted. Trading volumes are down 97 percent from peaks reached in January. In the latest sign of the market‚Äôs distress, the FTX cryptocurrency exchange filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, inflicting billions of dollars in losses on its clients and investors. So why is ICA Miami collecting NFTs? ‚ÄúOur collection, as well as our exhibitions and programs, seek to take on some of the most pressing and topical art and ideas that are happening today,‚Äù said Alex Gartenfeld, ICA Miami‚Äôs artistic director. ‚ÄúOver the last two or three years, one of the most ubiquitous and transformative conversations has been around how artists explore and develop their creativity through NFTs.‚Äù He said that digital art had a long history and that, while it found itself now ‚Äúat the center of the marketplace‚Äù and public attention, it was not that way for the preceding three decades. In any event, he added, museums are not concerned with the value of their art collections so ‚Äúthe groupthink is fairly irrelevant to the work that we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Last year, Refik Anadol plugged more than 138,000 images and text materials from the museum‚Äôs publicly available archive into a machine-learning model to create hundreds of colorful abstractions that he called ‚Äúmachine hallucinations,‚Äù selling them as NFTs, or nonfungible tokens. It was the beginning of a quiet partnership between Anadol, a 37-year-old Turkish American artist, and the MoMA curators Michelle Kuo and Paola Antonelli ‚Äî and it was a financial boon for both parties. Some of the blockchain-based artworks wound up selling for thousands of dollars, with the most exclusive one selling for $200,000. Within the fine print of the transactions was a note that the museum would earn nearly 17 percent of all primary sales and 5 percent of all secondary sales. For MoMA, struggling with pandemic attendance drop-off ‚Äî from about three million in normal times to 1.65 million last fiscal year ‚Äî growing a digital audience makes good financial sense. Now, the curators have invited Anadol to dig deeper into the MoMA archives for the new data-driven installation, ‚ÄúRefik Anadol: Unsupervised,‚Äù which will start Nov. 19 in the Gund Lobby and run through March 5. ‚ÄúBeing open to new technology is part of our responsibility,‚Äù said Antonelli, the museum‚Äôs senior curator for the department of architecture and design, who is known for guiding MoMA‚Äôs acquisitions of historical video games like Pac-Man and the @ symbol. ‚ÄúWe are never jumping on new technologies, but rather realizing that we need to keep pace with the world.‚Äù Image At left and right, Refik Anadol‚Äôs sample of data visualizations for ‚ÄúUnsupervised‚Äù ‚Äî what the artist calls ‚Äúmachine hallucinations,‚Äù at MoMA, 2022.Credit...Refik Anadol Studio; via The Museum of Modern Art, New York Image Credit...Refik Anadol Studio; via The Museum of Modern Art, New York We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

A Birkin with mammoth tusks affixed to it. One sporting the Grinch‚Äôs shaggy green fur. Others stamped with van Gogh‚Äôs ‚ÄúStarry Night‚Äù or populated by smiley emojis. Herm√®s swiftly sued the artist, Mason Rothschild, over the NFT project he called ‚ÄúMetaBirkins,‚Äù arguing that the company‚Äôs trademark was being diluted and that potential consumers might be fooled into buying the unaffiliated virtual goods. The case‚Äôs ramifications extended far beyond Herm√®s. In some of the first litigation to scrutinize the nature of digital assets sold on the blockchain, up for debate was whether NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, are strictly commodities or art shielded by the First Amendment. On Wednesday, a nine-person federal jury in Manhattan determined that Rothschild had infringed on the company‚Äôs trademark rights and awarded Herm√®s $133,000 in total damages. The jurors also found that his NFTs were not protected speech. Rothschild‚Äôs defeat was a major blow for the NFT market, which has often described itself as part of the creator economy. But the jury determined that MetaBirkins were more similar to commodities, which are subject to strict trademark laws that prevent copycats, than to artworks where appropriation is protected. In a statement after the verdict, Herm√®s said it was compelled to act to protect consumers and the integrity of its brand. ‚ÄúHerm√®s is a house of creation, craftsmanship and authenticity which has supported artists and freedom of expression since its founding,‚Äù it said.

Burning a purported drawing from Frida Kahlo‚Äôs personal diary didn‚Äôt help a businessman‚Äôs cause.,"First came the mariachi band, a flame-juggling dancer and the models in bathing suits and ball gowns sauntering beside the pool of a Miami mansion. Then the spectacle began. A businessman who built his wealth on waves of speculation ‚Äî riding the dot-com surge in the 1990s, and then the rapid growth of Bitcoin in recent years ‚Äî popped a drawing out of its frame that he heralded as a page from Frida Kahlo‚Äôs personal diary. Wearing a sequined blazer with the artist‚Äôs portrait on his back, he pinned the picture to a martini glass filled with blue rubbing alcohol. It was set aflame, and the artwork was reduced to ashes. Attendees at the opulent July gathering, which was captured in a promotional video, had been notified that the drawing was being ‚Äútransformed to live eternally in the digital realm‚Äù through the creation of nonfungible tokens that represented the ‚Äúrebirth & immortality of a timeless piece.‚Äù Those who chose to buy an NFT with the Ethereum cryptocurrency were promised exclusive access to events and the assurance that 30 percent of the proceeds would go toward charitable causes. But with his entrance into the murky world of NFTs, the businessman, Martin Mobarak, also generated incredulous headlines and an investigation by the authorities in Mexico, which classifies Kahlo‚Äôs artworks as national monuments. Some observers doubted that a relatively unknown collector would have access to a rare Kahlo drawing, leading to accusations of fraud. The destruction of ‚ÄúFantasmones Siniestros‚Äù (‚ÄúSinister Ghosts‚Äù) was an example of the high-stakes brinkmanship common in the NFT market, where a 97 percent drop in trading volumes is pushing some to extremes. Selling cryptocurrencies and blockchain assets has often relied on hype cycles, and Mobarak acknowledged he was looking to stir controversy. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

But that sci-fi premise is little more than a veneer. Not for nothing did Mary Shelley give ‚ÄúFrankenstein‚Äù the subtitle ‚ÄúThe Modern Prometheus‚Äù; the finest genre fiction has always examined humanity through allegory. So, too, does van der Aa‚Äôs spare yet richly complicated work, which is preoccupied less with futuristic speculation than timeless matters of the heart and mind, whether corporeal or in the cloud. Which is not to say that van der Aa is uninterested in the bleeding edge. Rather, for decades, and with mixed success, he has been at the fore of marrying traditional forms with new media ‚Äî inventing software and putting his film degree to regular use ‚Äî through, for example, 3-D technology in the opera ‚ÄúSunken Garden‚Äù and virtual reality in the poetic installation ‚ÄúEight.‚Äù The challenge, always, is in making sure the shiny new thing doesn‚Äôt overtake the music, but instead is gracefully incorporated into a balanced whole. Van der Aa achieved something like that in ‚ÄúEight,‚Äù complementing the immersion of VR with a score of poplike directness. And ‚ÄúUpload‚Äù is the work of an artist in absolute command of his toolkit, employing a restraint that makes for smooth shifts between acoustic and electric, live performance and film, without any one thing drawing attention to itself throughout the opera‚Äôs brisk 80 minutes.

Previous efforts to address this over the years have failed. But now, as musicians and other creative producers assert more control over their future sales and blockchain technology has allowed for easier tracking of intellectual property, two Stanford alumni have started a business to help visual artists reap the financial rewards when their work is resold privately or comes up for auction, in some cases at many multiples of the original price. ‚ÄúThere has been exponential growth in the secondary market, but artists have largely been left behind, even though they are essential to it,‚Äù Max Kendrick, one of the founders, said. ‚ÄúHow do we create a more sustainable model for the artist and the galleries that support them?‚Äù Charlie Jarvis, 24, a computer scientist, and Kendrick, 36, a former diplomat and a son of the sculptor Mel Kendrick, started the company, called Fairchain, in 2019. Little by little, it is gaining traction with artists and gallerists. ‚ÄúIf widely adopted, as it should be, it could be pretty revolutionary,‚Äù said the artist Hank Willis Thomas, an adviser to the company. ‚ÄúSo many artists who died poor spent their whole career giving away what they produced. ‚ÄúIn the music industry, it‚Äôs expected,‚Äù Thomas added. ‚ÄúI have friends on ‚ÄòLaw and Order‚Äô who, after 20 years, are still getting royalty checks.

Art Made With a Paintbrush - The New York Times,2022-02-12T10:00:22.000Z,By Zachary Small,"Now crypto collectors are investing in something more tangible, and traditional, like paintings and sculpture. And art dealers are rushing to woo them.","Felix Xu started his NFT art collection by purchasing a Chromie Squiggle, generated by an algorithm. Today, Xu, a 29-year-old Chinese tech executive, has more than 3,000 blockchain-based collectibles. But there is a hole burning in his crypto wallet that he would like to fill with real paintings. His budget stretches toward $500,000 and he is already on the wait-list for in-demand artists who use paint and moving brushes like Zhang Zipiao. So in December, Xu, a founder and chief executive of the start-ups Arpa and Bella Protocol, ventured through the gallery booths of Art Basel Miami Beach, where dealers from David Zwirner and Pace Gallery tried bending his ear toward the contemporary art market. He was looking for an education; they were looking for a sale. ‚ÄúI was really amazed with all the sculptures and paintings,‚Äù Xu said in an interview, crediting the fair with expanding his interest from blue-chip modernists like Picasso toward living artists like Nigel Cooke and Jessie Makinson. Xu is among the increasing number of NFT collectors looking to invest their cryptocurrency in something tangible: a traditional art collection, starting with the painting he bought in January by Renqian Yang, a Chinese artist living in New York. Critics have scoffed that a marriage between NFTs and the art world is impossible. But catering to the tastes of the crypto nouveau riche has become the frantic obsession of the commercial art world, which is reshaping itself around these new collectors nearly a year after artists like Beeple and Pak sold NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, for tens of millions of dollars, inspiring the typically technophobic art industry to head into the metaverse.

The argument that NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, represented the art market‚Äôs future was unappealing to the bulk of these buyers, leaving gallerists and auctioneers to focus their attention on a new class of millennial connoisseurs from the tech world. The arrangement left auction houses prioritizing Pak cubes and Bored Apes ‚Äî collectibles that are the closest one can get to brand-names in the crypto world ‚Äî in sales that further alienated the skeptics. But one year later, Sotheby‚Äôs has started using the more genteel language of art history to entice traditional collectors toward blockchain-based collectibles for a sale, Natively Digital NFT. It is running April 18-25 and is designed to unite early pioneers of computer art with their crypto counterparts. Traditional collectors are often drawn to provenance and pedigree, so a sale focused on the lineage of computer art might help convince them that NFT artists have a stronger art historical foundation beyond the beep and boop of internet forums. The event features some of the earliest examples of generative art, a genre where control of the creative process is determined by algorithms or a predetermined process to create images. Examples include artists working in the 1960s and 1970s like Vera Molnar, Chuck Csuri and Roman Verostko alongside more recent offerings from the digital artists Dmitri Cherniak, Tyler Hobbs and Anna Ridler.

Has it Changed Art? - The New York Times,2022-03-03T16:32:39.000Z,By Blake Gopnik,Hardly at all.,"Around 1425, the Florentine artist Masaccio painted the first major works in one-point perspective. That revolutionized what artists could do ever after. In Paris in 1839, Louis-Jacques-Mand√© Daguerre demonstrated his new photographic invention. It changed the nature of visual representation and museum walls haven‚Äôt been the same since. On March 11, 2021, all of one year ago, Mike Winkelmann, whose nom d‚Äôartiste is Beeple, sold a collage of computer illustrations for $69 million simply because that collage came attached to a digital certificate called an NFT. That colossal price launched a mad scramble among creators of all kinds ‚Äî illustrators, musicians, photographers, even a few veteran avant-gardists ‚Äî to join the NFT gold rush. In the 12 months since, something like $44 billion has been spent on about six million NFTs, usually issued to certify digital creations but sometimes for physical objects like paintings and sculptures. But did this vast tsunami of ‚ÄúNFT art‚Äù actually trigger any kind of sea change in what art looks like, what it means or what, in some profound sense, it is? Hardly at all, and there‚Äôs a chance such a change might barely be possible: That‚Äôs because ‚ÄúNFT art‚Äù simply does not exist.

But new technology could make it a better bet.,"LONDON ‚Äî In recent years, there has been plenty of talk of the ‚Äúfinancialization‚Äù of art. As prices soar to new levels and digital technology opens new markets, that talk is getting louder. Last month in London, DACS, Britain‚Äôs leading artists‚Äô rights management organization, unveiled ‚ÄúThe Art Market 2.0‚Äù to lawmakers in the House of Commons. A report by academics at the Alan Turing Institute in London and Oxford University, it envisioned how blockchain technology might ‚Äúchange the balance of economic power in the art market‚Äù and ‚Äúintegrate art into the financial sector.‚Äù A financialized Art Market 2.0 would lead to an ‚Äúexplosion of liquidity and value,‚Äù according to the report. A day later at the London Business School‚Äôs 10th Art Investment Conference, held at Phillips auction house, there were, as usual, sessions discussing the performance of art as a financial asset class. This year, however, the event focused on whether ‚Äúnew technologies can make art a better investment.‚Äù Image Alain Servais, a Belgian collector and former investment banker, said he didn‚Äôt consider art an asset class. ‚ÄúThese are wealthy people‚Äôs toys,‚Äù he said.Credit...London Business School ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not Wall Street,‚Äù Alain Servais, a Belgian collector, former investment banker and one of the speakers at the conference, said in an interview. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think art can be considered as an asset class.‚Äù He pointed to the art market‚Äôs lack of liquidity and regulation and to the ability of trade insiders to control the prices of certain highly collectible names. ‚ÄúThese are wealthy people‚Äôs toys,‚Äù he said.

Why? Because he sold a photograph of a potato. Let‚Äôs back up. Mr. Abosch, 48, is an Irish conceptual artist and photographer who lives in New York. He is also interested in the blockchain, the technology best known for its use in virtual currencies like Bitcoin and ether. The strange culture surrounding these cryptocurrencies is increasingly making its way into art, in works that explore value, decentralization and the buzz around digital money.

On the one hand, the attention generated by the sale was exciting, he said. ‚ÄúOn the other hand, the focus shifts from the artistic value to monetary value of the work, and for most artists the art is an extension of the artist, so you yourself start to feel commodified,‚Äù Mr. Abosch said. ‚ÄúIn order to sort of control that, I began to think of myself as a coin.‚Äù Mr. Abosch turned to the blockchain, which essentially records a series of transactions across a large, open network of computers. The Ethereum blockchain allows coders to create virtual tokens, which can be transferred between users. They‚Äôre not always currencies, exactly, but something like them.

That is the question behind financial products for investors attracted by soaring art prices but intimidated by the complexity and opacity of the market. It is why art funds were all the rage in the early 2000s, and why new variations continue to emerge. At the same time, entrepreneurs are trying to iron out the archaic inefficiencies of the art world with new types of financial products, particularly the secure ledgers of blockchain. While the technology is best known as the basis of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, its promise of transparency could transform sectors like banking and insurance and, some say, art. ‚ÄúMore transparency equals more trust, more trust equals more transactions, more transactions equals stronger markets,‚Äù Anne Bracegirdle, a specialist in the photographs department at Christie‚Äôs, said on Tuesday at the auction house‚Äôs first Art & Tech Summit, dedicated to exploring blockchain. According to Ms. Bracegirdle, blockchain‚Äôs decentralized record-keeping could create a ‚Äúmore welcoming art ecosystem‚Äù in which collectors and professionals routinely verify the authenticity, provenance and ownership of artworks on an industrywide registry securely situated in the cloud. Hers was one of the more utopian visions put forward by the roughly 30 panelists at Christie‚Äôs daylong conference, however. There was plenty of skepticism on offer.

These kinds of noises are also ubiquitous in the strange and alluring recent videos in Mika Rottenberg‚Äôs ‚ÄúEasypieces,‚Äù which takes its title from Richard P. Feynman‚Äôs book ‚ÄúSix Easy Pieces‚Äù (1994): his introduction to the fundamentals of physics for general audiences. The centerpiece of this show at the New Museum, which was curated by Margot Norton, is ‚ÄúSpaghetti Blockchain‚Äù (2019), a 21-minute video that ricochets among warbling Tuvan throat singers in Siberia, the CERN antimatter factory in Switzerland, a potato farm in Maine and an imaginary manufacturer of A.S.M.R. products. In addition to bright colors and bristling, popping and whirring sounds, the video also relies on classically Surrealist, dreamlike scenarios. The idea of matter, and the relationship between animate and inanimate objects, purports to be at its core, although this is a bit lost in the A.S.M.R. sensorium and the excess of sound and color that has come to characterize Ms. Rottenberg‚Äôs work.

Here again, absurd actions and juxtapositions reign, reminding you of the famous statement by the French writer Isidore Ducasse, better known as the Comte de Lautr√©amont, which was adopted by the Surrealists: ‚ÄúBeautiful as the accidental encounter, on a dissecting table, of a sewing machine and an umbrella.‚Äù The much shorter video ‚ÄúSneeze‚Äù (2012) depicts men in business suits sneezing out rabbits or hunks of meat, while ‚ÄúCosmic Generator (Tunnel Variant),‚Äù from 2017, pivots on another unlikely pairing: a Chinese restaurant in the Mexican city of Mexicali and a wholesale market in Yiwu, China.

But this precious metal doesn‚Äôt actually exist. The frenzy is for so-called cryptocurrencies ‚Äî or encrypted digital money ‚Äî and their value skyrocketed in 2017. The price of Bitcoin, the pioneer decentralized virtual currency, rose more than 1,300 percent last year, despite plunging 40 percent at one point in December. A Bitcoin rival, Ether, was up 8,000 percent. It is thought that the total worldwide value of cryptocurrencies could reach $1 trillion this year. Bitcoin and its derivatives have, for the moment, proved too volatile and unwieldy for day-to-day transactions. Yet the cryptocurrency model, underpinned by decentralized blockchain ledger technology, is increasingly becoming a force in more specialized areas of the economy. The art world is one of them. On Dec. 16, the nascent market for what might be called cryptoart appeared to reach a new level when the hitherto-unknown Distributed Gallery announced the auction of ‚ÄúReady Made Token,‚Äù a unique unit of a cryptocurrency that the gallery said was created by Richard Prince using technology from Ethereum, the network responsible for Ether. The online gallery describes itself as the first to specialize in ‚Äúblockchain-based artwork and exhibition.‚Äù It invited bids for the work, starting at one Ether, equivalent to about $650 at the time. (As of Friday, one Ether was worth about $1,200, according to ethereumprice.org.) The timed auction ends on Monday. The appearance of a crypto ‚Äúready-made‚Äù by an artist of Mr. Prince‚Äôs stature seemed to suddenly put blockchain on the art world map. Distributed Gallery even arranged for Mr. Prince to attend the inaugural Rare Digital Art Festival in New York on Saturday. But when buying into the world of cryptocurrencies, it can be difficult to determine what is real.

The portrait, produced by artificial intelligence, hung on the wall opposite an Andy Warhol print and just to the right of a bronze work by Roy Lichtenstein. There were some smiles and at least one frown. Two people snapped cellphone pictures of the work, which looked as though someone had taken a sponge to a 17th-century oil portrait. The arrival of what some call the infant stages of the next great art movement at one of the world‚Äôs leading auction houses was greeted nonchalantly, with a nod of understanding and a sip of mezcal margarita. Christie‚Äôs is hoping for a more explosive reaction on Thursday, when the gavel comes down on ‚ÄúEdmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy,‚Äù formally testing the art market‚Äôs interest in AI art. The work ‚Äî estimated at $7,000-$10,000 ‚Äî was a collaboration by the members of Obvious, a French trio composed of a student of machine learning and two business school graduates, none of whom have a background in art. There was no paint or brushes involved, just an algorithm that learns to imitate sets of images fed by humans ‚Äî in this case, thousands of portraits spanning the 14th century to the 20th. But is it art? Fr√©d√©rique Baumgartner, an art historian at Columbia University, said the AI work raised questions about ‚Äúintention and authorship,‚Äù but so, too, did artists from the past, including Marcel Duchamp (who famously made art out of a urinal). She went on to compare the portrait‚Äôs contrasting tones, coupled with the subject‚Äôs sober dress, with the old master of the Dutch Golden Age, Rembrandt van Rijn ‚Äî though she quickly added, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs if I look half-closing my eyes.‚Äù Image Pierre Fautrel, one of the three members of the group Obvious that made the portrait using AI, in New York last week.Credit...Nathan Bajar for The New York Times The unusual sale shows the challenge traditional auction houses face staying relevant in a culture that moves at WiFi-enabled speeds.

Its exhibitions include one about Japanese architecture from 1945 to the present day, and the recently opened ‚ÄúJapanorama,‚Äù a survey of Japan‚Äôs contemporary art since 1970, on view through March 5. ‚ÄúJapanorama‚Äù picks up where an important 1986 exhibition at the Pompidou Center in Paris, ‚ÄúAvant-Garde Arts of Japan 1910-1970,‚Äù left off. That show presented some important Japanese artists abroad for the first time ‚Äî but it examined their work as influenced by, and even dependent on, Western art traditions. Aomi Okabe, who was part of the 1986 show‚Äôs curatorial committee and is currently artistic director of exhibitions at the Japanese Culture House of Paris, said that, at the time, ‚Äúthe French public considered modern Japanese paintings of the early 20th century copies of European art, especially from France.‚Äù Image The Pompidou Center in Metz is holding two Japan-themed exhibitions in its fall program.Credit...Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times The subtitle of ‚ÄúJapanorama‚Äù is ‚ÄúNew Vision on Art Since 1970,‚Äù the year that Japan began to reassert its own cultural identity, spurred by the new confidence it found at Expo ‚Äô70 in Osaka. The show is a ‚Äúdiscovery of what was overlooked,‚Äù the curator, Yuko Hasegawa, said. While Japan wrestled with complicated issues of modernization and heritage, its culture was understood in the West though clich√©d binaries: The ascetic Zen of a rock garden on one hand, the gleeful kitsch of Hello Kitty on the other. The exhibition corrects this reductive caricature, examining the way the push and pull between tradition and technology, individual and collective, have shaped the culture in unique ways. For European audiences, what‚Äôs new about this ‚ÄúNew Vision‚Äù is examining contemporary Japanese art on its own terms. European interest in Japanese art dates back to the 19th century ‚Äî van Gogh collected Ukiyo-e prints, Monet modeled his water lily pond at Giverny on Japanese gardens ‚Äî yet many of today‚Äôs art institutions rarely showcase non-Western contemporary art. There have been piecemeal exhibitions in Paris over the past year, among them shows at the Palais de Tokyo, Le Bal, Fondation Cartier and the European House of Photography. But no exhibition here in France has examined Japanese creativity across eras, mediums and generations. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Trump is holding a fund-raiser with the Republican National Committee on Tuesday in New York City, Alexandra Stevenson reports in DealBook The event will be hosted by a whoís who of the financial world, including John A. Paulson, whose hedge fund made billions betting on the collapse of the housing market. He will be joined by Stephen A. Feinberg, the founder of Cerberus Capital Management, and Peter Kalikow, the real estate magnate. Tickets were going for $50,000 a person, although the hosts are paying $250,000 a couple. An invitation seen by The New York Times said that additional details would be disclosed once a reservation had been made. The attendance of these men, some of whom had not publicly declared their support for the presumptive party nominee, indicate that a small, but growing crowd in the financial sphere is warming up to the idea of backing Mr. Trump. This is crucial for the presidential candidate as Hillary Clintonís donor network includes the billionaire George Soros and she has the backing of some well-known Wall Street executives. Other hosts include Wilbur L. Ross, a distressed debt specialist, and Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund executive. Mr. Scaramucci said on Thursday that he expected about 50 or 60 people to attend the dinner, which is expected to be held at someoneís home, although the Secret Service will not disclose the location until the day before the event. Mr. Scaramucci was among the first on Wall Street to publicly announce his support for Mr. Trump and has been instrumental in introducing Mr. Trump to the hedge fund and private equity world. But other executives have been more wary of supporting Mr. Trump, who has spoken out against the hedge fund industry and the generous compensation packages hedge funds give themselves. Mr. Trump also said he planned to end carried interest, which allows private equity and hedge fund executives to pay lower taxes by treating their income as capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.",,Related to Blockchain

The digital security firm Symantec said that in three recent attacks, the thieves used a rare piece of code that had been seen in only two previous cases ó the hacking attack on Sony Pictures in 2014 and attacks on banks and media companies in South Korea the year before. Symantec researchers said the evidence linked an attack at a bank in the Philippines last October with attacks on Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam in December and another in February that resulted in the theft of $81 million from the central bank of Bangladesh. Eric Chien, a security researcher at Symantec who found the code used across the attacks, said it was the first time that a nation had used online attacks for financial gain. The attacks raised alarm bells because the thieves gained access to Swift, which is considered the worldís most secure payment messaging system. It is used by 11,000 banks and companies to move money between countries, making it a tempting target. Swift itself had warned of a coordinated assault on banks, although it stressed that it was the banksí connections to its networks, rather than the network itself, that were breached. The possibility that Pyongyang had turned to digital theft was not surprising. North Koreaís economy has been ravaged by sanctions and food shortages. Its gross domestic product was estimated to be $12 billion to $40 billion, compared with South Koreaís $1.4 trillion. ìIf you presume itís North Korea, $1 billion is almost 10 percent of their G.D.P.,î Mr. Chien said. ìThis is not small change for them.î There is no evidence to date that the thieves have gone after large American or European banks, though new possible attacks are being reported weekly. Last week, evidence emerged that Banco del Austro, an Ecuadorean bank, was infiltrated by hackers who were able to sneak into the Swift network. FireEye, the security firm investigating the intrusion on Bangladeshís central bank, is looking at several more undisclosed cases where banksí systems were compromised, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing a person familiar with the matter. The suspected attacks involved eight other banks, all of which are in Asia. Analysts worry that the breaches could hold back global finance; larger banks may become reluctant or even refuse to transact with smaller banks in the developing world unless they have assurances that their networks would not be compromised. GOOGLE WINS COPYRIGHT DISPUTE WITH ORACLE | A judged ruled in Googleís favor in a legal dispute with Oracle over software used to power most of the worldís smartphones, Nick Wingfield and Quentin Hardy report in The New York Times. Oracle contended that Google used copyrighted material in the software code for the Android mobile phone operating system. Oracle asked for $9 billion from Google. Google said it had made fair use of that code and owed nothing. Software developers, who operate in the same way Google did when it comes to open-source software, cheered the victory. Open-source products are released, often with some restrictions, for anyone to use and modify. Chris Dixon, a technology investor with Andreessen Horowitz, called it ìgreat news for progress and innovation.î Android relies in part on Java, an open-source software language the Oracle acquired when it bought Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion in 2010. Oracle accused Google executives of violating Oracleís copyright by using aspects of Java without permission. The courtroom fight could offer clarity on legal rules surrounding open-source technology, which is used in everything from smartphones and digital recording devices to the software that runs many of the worldís biggest data centers. People who worked with open-source technology had feared that a victory for Oracle would lead to other similar demands.",,Related to Blockchain

Is Twitter the Way to Get It? - The New York Times,2022-05-11T09:00:18.000Z,By Ross Douthat,America s richest man tries to†halt the liberal retreat from dynamism.,"As strongly supported Obama for President,as Elon Musk tweeted late last month, part of the spree of ideological comments accompanying his continuing takeover of Twitter, debut today. Democratic Party has been hijacked by extremists. Around the same time, he set the social-media platform ablaze by reposting a cartoon showing a stick figure comfortably on the center-left in 2008 redefined as a right-wing bigot by 2021 because the left-wing stick figure had raced way off to the left. Then this week, he expressed the same kind of thought in the abbreviated style for which the site is famous: ‚ÄúTwitter obv has a strong left wing bias.‚Äù And now, at last, we have the news that he‚Äôs likely to allow Donald Trump to tweet freely once again. All of these comments and promises align the country‚Äôs richest man with the rightward side in our culture war. But though I don‚Äôt know Musk ‚Äî I‚Äôve never interviewed him or hung out with him in any secret billionaire lair ‚Äî I think I know enough about him, and I know enough Silicon Valley people like him, to suggest that neither his tweeted self-descriptions nor the criticisms being lobbed his way capture what‚Äôs distinctive about his position and worldview. A term like ‚Äúconservative‚Äù doesn‚Äôt fit the Tesla tycoon; even ‚Äúlibertarian,‚Äù while closer to the mark, associates Musk with a lot of ideas that I don‚Äôt think he particularly cares about. A better label comes from Virginia Postrel, in her 1998 book ‚ÄúThe Future and Its Enemies‚Äù: Musk is what she calls a ‚Äúdynamist,‚Äù meaning someone whose primary commitments are to exploration and discovery, someone who believes that the best society is one that‚Äôs always inventing, transforming, doing something new. If you think this sounds uncontroversial, think again. First, the dynamist may not care where novelty and invention spring from: Unlike the purist libertarian, he might be indifferent to questions of public versus private spending, happy to embrace government help if that‚Äôs what it takes to get the new thing off the ground ‚Äî and happy to take that help from regimes like Communist China no less than from our own. And he may be willing to risk much more than either the typical progressive or the typical conservative for the sake of innovation. Political principle, social stability and moral order are all potentially negotiable when discovery alone is your North Star. For many people, dynamism is contingent ‚Äî on how invested you are in the world as it is, whether you stand to lose or benefit from innovations, and where your moral intuitions lie. (I am personally a dynamist about Musk‚Äôs Mars colony but not Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs metaverse; flying cars, yes, sex robots, not so much.) Even in the tech world, your appetite for dynamism depends on where you stand: If you‚Äôre lucky enough to work for one of Silicon Valley‚Äôs near monopolies, the new powers of the age, you may not be that interested in further churn or change.

2,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/opinion/crypto-crash-bitcoin.html,Opinion | Crashing Crypto: Is This Time Different? - The New York Times,2022-05-17T17:45:06.000Z,By Paul Krugman,Celebrity endorsements may signal the end of an era.,"Last week TerraUSD, a stablecoin ‚Äî a system that was supposed to perform a lot like a conventional bank account but was backed only by a cryptocurrency called Luna ‚Äî collapsed. Luna lost 97 percent of its value over the course of just 24 hours, apparently destroying some investors‚Äô life savings. The event shook the crypto world in general, but the truth is that this world was looking pretty shaky even before the Terra disaster. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, peaked last November and has since declined by more than 50 percent. Here‚Äôs one way to think about that decline. Almost everyone is concerned about the rising cost of living; the Consumer Price Index ‚Äî the cost of a representative basket of goods and services ‚Äî has gone up about 4 percent over the past six months. But the cost of the same basket in Bitcoin has risen around 120 percent, which means inflation at an annualized rate of about 380 percent. And other cryptocurrencies have performed far worse. Two cities ‚Äî Miami and New York ‚Äî have introduced their own cryptocurrencies, with enthusiastic support from their mayors. MiamiCoin is down more than 90 percent from its peak, and NewYorkCityCoin is down more than 80 percent. By now, we‚Äôve all heard of them, but what exactly are cryptocurrencies? Many people ‚Äî including, I fear, many people who have invested in them ‚Äî probably still don‚Äôt fully understand them. Saying that they‚Äôre digital assets doesn‚Äôt really get at it. My bank account, which I mainly reach online, is also a digital asset, for all practical purposes. What‚Äôs distinctive about cryptocurrencies is how ownership is established. I own the money in my bank account because the law says I do, and the bank enforces that legal claim by requiring, one way or another, that I prove that I am, in fact, me. Ownership of a crypto asset is established through what‚Äôs known as the blockchain, an encrypted (hence the name) digital record of all previous transfers of ownership that supposedly obviates the need for an external party, such as a bank, to validate a claim.

The 2010 book by Michael Lewis, made into a 2015 film, told the story of the 2008 global financial crisis by following a handful of investors who were willing to bet on the unthinkable ‚Äî the proposition that the huge rise in housing prices in the years before the crisis was a bubble, and that many of the seemingly sophisticated financial instruments that helped inflate housing would eventually be revealed as worthless junk. Why were so few willing to bet against the bubble? A large part of the answer, I‚Äôd suggest, was what we might call the incredulity factor ‚Äî the sheer scale of the mispricing the skeptics claimed to see. Even though there was clear evidence that housing prices were out of line, it was hard to believe they could be that far out of line ‚Äî that $6 trillion in real estate wealth would evaporate, that investors in mortgage-backed securities would lose around $1 trillion. It just didn‚Äôt seem plausible that markets, and the conventional wisdom saying that markets were OK, could be that wrong. But they were. Which brings us to the current state of crypto. Last week the Federal Trade Commission reported that ‚Äúcryptocurrency is quickly becoming the payment of choice for many scammers,‚Äù accounting for ‚Äúabout one of every four dollars reported lost to fraud.‚Äù Given how small a role cryptocurrency plays in ordinary transactions, that‚Äôs impressive. True, the sum reported by the F.T.C. isn‚Äôt that big ‚Äî around $1 billion since 2021 ‚Äî but this counts only reported losses to outright fraud, where people were suckered into paying for nonexistent assets. It doesn‚Äôt count scams that went unreported, let alone money invested in assets that existed, sort of, but were fundamentally worthless ‚Äî assets like TerraUSD, a ‚Äústablecoin‚Äù that was neither stable nor a coin. TerraUSD‚Äôs collapse last month eliminated $18 billion in value, in some cases consuming people‚Äôs life savings. As far as we know, TerraUSD‚Äôs founders actually believed in their product and didn‚Äôt simply steal investors‚Äô money, so they didn‚Äôt engage in fraud in a legal sense. But their investors lost their savings anyway. Who‚Äôs next? As Hillary Allen recently wrote in The Financial Times, TerraUSD may have been exceptionally fragile, but the truth is that it‚Äôs hard to see why stablecoins in general should exist. ‚ÄúStablecoins start with a convoluted and inefficient base technology in order to avoid intermediaries‚Äù ‚Äî that is, conventional banks ‚Äî ‚Äúand then add intermediaries (often with apparent conflicts of interest) back in.‚Äù As a number of analysts have pointed out, stablecoins may seem high-tech and futuristic, but what they most resemble are 19th-century banks, specifically U.S. banks during the ‚Äúfree banking‚Äù era before the Civil War, when paper currency was issued by largely unregulated private institutions. Many of these banks failed, in some cases due to fraud but mostly due to bad investments. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

4,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/opinion/crypto-terra-luna-blockchain.html,Opinion | Yes  Crypto Is Crashing Again. Blockchain Will Survive. - The New York Times,2022-06-16T09:00:18.000Z,By Maria Bustillos,Don t be distracted by the shenanigans going on in the casino. ,"This week, the crypto market plummeted for the second time in a month, in tandem with a sharp drop in global stock markets. The collapse, not the first of its kind, showed again how the violent swings of a largely unregulated market warp the development of a transformative technology. But crypto is just one aspect of the larger blockchain universe. Its skeptics and fans alike must learn to see it as a technological experiment, instead of just a blatant scam or a speculative path to riches. Why has the market fallen apart in such spectacular fashion? The first recent crash, when the cryptocurrency market plunged 36 percent in a week in May, offers a clue. The collapse was largely set off by the death spiral of a cryptocurrency system called Terra Luna, made up of the coin Luna and its associated stablecoin, TerraUSD. At its dizzying heights in the spring, it represented roughly 3 percent of the total crypto market. Fear spread throughout the exchanges, and with it came panic selling. After the second crash this week, the cryptocurrency market is still worth in total nearly $1 trillion (about one-third of last November‚Äôs peak). Only a few of the 19,000 cryptocurrencies that have been created since 2009 are now worth billions. Most have failed. The crypto market is wildly volatile not because of cryptocurrency‚Äôs underlying technology, but because of the uneasy and often dangerously unstable junction between emerging technologies and regular money. Viewed from the long perspective of market history, this instability isn‚Äôt remotely new. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, internet stocks were a white-knuckle ride, just as crypto is now. Back then, too, hucksterism was rampant, the atmosphere was like a casino, and almost any idea with an ‚Äúe‚Äù in front of it ‚Äî no matter how reckless or silly ‚Äî attracted attention from investors and the news media. Seemingly every day, fortunes were spectacularly made and lost. But even as Napster, Webvan and eToys flamed out, a revolution was taking place. Despite all the shenanigans going on in the casino, real and lasting companies, publications and communities were built and thrived online. The internet survived, more or less. Terraform Labs, the company behind TerraUSD and Luna, was founded in 2018 by Do Kwon, a computer scientist and entrepreneur in South Korea. Mr. Kwon, now 30, is a notoriously brazen hustler who has made waves for calling his critics ‚Äúpoor‚Äù and ‚Äúcockroaches.‚Äù But despite his lack of polish, and the early warnings from developers and analysts about the technical weaknesses of his plans, he succeeded in raising $200 million in venture capital from 2018 to 2021. His company boasted of reaching an elusive goal in crypto, namely, the establishment of a truly ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù stablecoin. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

5,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/opinion/crypto-rolexes-fomo-economy.html,Opinion | Crypto  Houses  Sneakers  Rolexes: How FOMO Drove the Economy - The New York Times,2022-06-16T19:00:08.000Z,By Farhad Manjoo,"For millions of people, Bitcoin, like real estate and dot-coms before it, offered hope for escaping dead-end jobs.","The lowest-priced, stainless-steel version of the Cosmograph Daytona, the Rolex model that Paul Newman made famous, carries a suggested retail price of $14,550. But you‚Äôre unlikely to snag one so cheap. Demand for luxury mechanical wristwatches has far outstripped supply in the last few years, and the waiting list for the most popular Rolex models ‚Äî if you can first convince an authorized dealer that you are worthy of one ‚Äî is now said to be several years long. According to WatchCharts, a price database for watch collectors, a current-model Daytona sells for more than $40,000 on the secondary market; over the last five years, the Daytona‚Äôs aftermarket price has grown by an average of 20 percent annually, making it a better investment than the S&P 500 over the same period. It‚Äôs not just prices for high-end watches that soared during the pandemic. For a wide range of collectible goods ‚Äî among them fine art, classic cars, luxury handbags, sneakers, comic books and trading cards ‚Äî the last few years were bubblier than a bottle of Dom P√©rignon (whose prices for certain vintages have also shot up). Then there‚Äôs the market for houses, an admittedly more practical scarce good, where prices also rose to intolerable new heights in recent years. I‚Äôve been thinking about these asset bubbles a lot lately, especially as I‚Äôve been following the crash of Bitcoin, Ethereum, NFTs and the larger cryptocurrency industry that grew so hot during the pandemic. Proponents of DeFi ‚Äî crypto jargon for ‚Äúdecentralized finance,‚Äù which essentially seeks to replicate the financial-services industry with crypto-based systems ‚Äî argue that the technology will expand access to financial products and unleash a wave of innovation now hampered by the overlords of traditional finance, what they derisively call TradFi. But it‚Äôs fast becoming clear that crypto was just another collectible pumped up by the same forces inflating the market for Yeezys and Birkin bags ‚Äî a lot of money sloshing around the world, not a lot of obvious places to put it, and a fear of missing out on something that everyone else seemed to think would be hot. Just as a Rolex does not tell time any better than a regular wristwatch ‚Äî in fact, electronic watches are far more accurate than mechanical ones ‚Äî DeFi seems to do nothing better than TradFi, and in a lot of practical ways it‚Äôs worse. As a group of computer scientists and other tech experts wrote in an open letter to Congress recently: ‚ÄúBy its very design, blockchain technology is poorly suited for just about every purpose currently touted as a present or potential source of public benefit.‚Äù We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

The gist: the increasing dangers from the amplification and weaponization of social media platforms by malevolent players and ‚Äî more important ‚Äî the sloppy management of these powerful systems by their creators, who hid behind flimsy excuses for their abrogation of responsibility. That all may seem obvious today, but it was anything but just a few short years ago. The fact that it‚Äôs arguably worse now is a sad bookend to my time with The Times. Central to my argument was showing how Facebook ‚Äî the company hiding in plain sight behind its new name, Meta ‚Äî was the most egregious perpetrator of this worrisome trend. Even then the huge company was still growing, so it was playing a key role in the metastasizing problem. Facebook was being used at the time to sway elections by some digital thugs. ‚ÄúWe face determined, well-funded adversaries who will never give up and are constantly changing tactics. It‚Äôs an arms race and we need to constantly improve too,‚Äù Facebook claimed. That gave me the perfect in, which I took and ran away with: The arms race metaphor is a good one, but not for the reasons Facebook intended. Here‚Äôs how I see it: Facebook, as well as Twitter and Google‚Äôs YouTube, have become the digital arms dealers of the modern age. All these companies began with a gauzy credo to change the world. But they have done that in ways they did not imagine ‚Äî by weaponizing pretty much everything that could be weaponized. They have mutated human communication, so that connecting people has too often become about pitting them against one another and turbocharged that discord to an unprecedented and damaging volume. They have weaponized social media. They have weaponized the First Amendment. They have weaponized civic discourse. And they have weaponized, most of all, politics. I thought what was happening and what would continue happening was obvious, but it caused a stir nonetheless; I was accused of being needlessly alarmist. The notion of social media‚Äôs toxicity seems almost quaint today, especially against the backdrop of the congressional hearings now underway detailing how the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol unfolded. Most of the blame for that tragic event is the fault of men (we see you, Donald Trump) and women (thanks to emails and texts, you‚Äôre not invisible either, Ginni Thomas) acting egregiously and possibly illegally in real life. But there is also the matter of how much online communication tools have supplanted and turbocharged all others that came before them, like the telephone and the fax machine, to organize, to conspire and, mostly, to propagandize. It all feels like the TV show ‚ÄúScandal,‚Äù except even stupider, more dangerous and less believable ‚Äî yet here we are hearing daily tales of skulduggery that are profoundly damaging to democracy. No surprise, these tales contain a major toxic dollop of tech to help facilitate the ‚ÄúAmerican carnage‚Äù (not my phrase but Trump‚Äôs, and it works here).

7,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/11/opinion/cryptocurrency-federal-reserve.html,Opinion | Crypto Is Crashing. Where Were the Regulators? - The New York Times,2022-07-11T23:00:07.000Z,By Paul Krugman,An anatomy materializes of a postmodern pyramid scheme.,"When the Federal Reserve speaks, it speaks in Fedspeak. A pithy turn of phrase or a striking metaphor can all too easily turn into a headline, causing big market moves and a public backlash. So dry technical language and euphemisms are usually the way to go. Given this reality, the bluntness of a recent speech on crypto regulation by Lael Brainard, the Fed vice chair, is almost shocking. True, Brainard didn‚Äôt go as far as Jim Chanos, the famous short-seller, who called crypto a ‚Äúpredatory junkyard.‚Äù But she came close. The very first heading in her remarks was, ‚ÄúDistinguishing Responsible Innovation From Regulatory Evasion,‚Äù and she strongly suggested that much of the crypto universe is driven by the latter. Traditional banking is regulated for a reason; crypto, in bypassing these regulations, she said, has created an environment subject to bank runs, not to mention ‚Äútheft, hacks and ransom attacks‚Äù ‚Äî plus ‚Äúmoney laundering and financing of terrorism.‚Äù Other than that, it‚Äôs all good. The thing is, most of Brainard‚Äôs litany has been obvious for some time to independent observers. So why are we only now hearing serious calls for regulation? Cryptocurrencies have been around since 2009, and in all this time they have never come to play a major role in real-world transactions ‚Äî El Salvador‚Äôs much-hyped attempt to make bitcoin its national currency has become a debacle. So how did cryptocurrencies come to be worth almost $3 trillion at their peak? (Two-thirds of that value has now vanished.) Why was nothing done to rein in ‚Äústablecoins,‚Äù which were supposedly pegged to the U.S. dollar but were clearly subject to all the risks of unregulated banking, and are now experiencing a cascading series of collapses reminiscent of the wave of bank failures that helped make the Great Depression great?

8,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/28/opinion/cat-video-game.html,Opinion | What Is It Like to Be a Cat? - The New York Times,2022-07-28T19:36:06.000Z,By Jay Caspian Kang,Playing the hit video game ‚ÄúStray‚Äù made me think that hyperrealism is overhyped. ,"Video game marketing, as a rule, relies on the idea that some new frontier has been breached in our journey to completely separate our brains from the dull demands of our bodies. This is true for actually groundbreaking classic games like SimCity and Braid, but also applies to games that get rereleased year after year after year with minor tweaks. As a result, an industry that has had very few widespread advances in the past 20 years ends up talking about itself in almost revolutionary terms. This is Madden like you‚Äôve never seen it before! These are all lies ‚Äî I have played hundreds of hours of Madden and can report that there is no version of either that I have not seen before. I enjoy playing video games, but I play them like I drink coffee: regularly, with minimal discretion or taste, and even less stimulation. Most of the time I am just pressing buttons to see some little avatar of myself do something on the screen. For the past week, my wife, 5-year-old daughter and I have been playing Stray, which, as of this printing, is one of the best-reviewed games of the year. The sell is very simple: You are an orange cat. Not a cartoon cat that tells jokes and carries around guns, but just a regular cat who scratches couches, naps and jumps in boxes. There‚Äôs a very long and honestly somewhat flat story line that involves androids, an apocalypse and mutant rats, but none of that really matters. Stray is a hit, in large part, because gamers feel like this is what being a cat must really be like. It reminded me a bit of the 1988 French film ‚ÄúThe Bear,‚Äù which tried to show the life of two real bears who acted like bears and did not speak English or break out into song or whatever. The point is that you don‚Äôt need an anthropomorphized version of the animal ‚Äî this is the real thing. The ‚Äúrealness‚Äù of Stray is apparently so complete that it puts some real cats in an almost hypnotic trance as they watch the unnamed video game cat amble around a postapocalyptic landscape. (This did not happen to my 13-year-old cat, Bobbi, who, like most real cats, spends her days peeing on the bathroom floor next to her litter box, pooping in the garden and cannot be bothered to pose for videos.) I want to dwell for a moment on this idea of realism in video games because I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs a particularly worthwhile pursuit to just make games that almost perfectly mimic an actual thing. One of the most impressive and mind-bending games I‚Äôve played was called Braid, an independently produced 2008 title in which you control a little man in a blazer as he hops around a castle filled with puzzles. You solve these puzzles by manipulating time ‚Äî you have the power to rewind time but keep certain objects stuck in the present, which then changes the conditions of the game in a butterfly effect type of way. Braid changed the dimensions of gaming and proved you could exist in multiple realities at once. This effect was so disorienting and powerful that after playing the game for a few hours, I went downstairs to fix myself a sandwich and found that I could not perform the task without reminding myself the order in which one places the bread, the meat and the condiments. The developers of Stray and Braid certainly had different goals in mind when they made those respective titles, but I do think the difference between them underscores a lively and interesting debate about the artistic value of a video game. Realism and the idea that a video game should make you feel like you‚Äôre actually something, whether a cat or even Spiderman (a funny breakdown of the latter can be found here), has been a longstanding measure of quality in the industry. Games are judged on how closely their graphics adhere to real life and the ‚Äúimmersiveness‚Äù of their gameplay, which is oftentimes just another way of saying something like, ‚ÄúThis really felt like I was a cat.‚Äù These aren‚Äôt monolithic standards to be sure, but judging video games on how closely they adhere to reality seems similar to judging paintings solely through the school of photorealism.

And they‚ have given rise to an entire ecosystem of financial speculation, get rich quick schemes, and in some cases outright fraud. But there is another side of crypto that gets less attention: the segment of the community that is interested in the way the technology that powers crypto can decentralize decision making, make institutions more transparent and transform the way organizations are governed. That s the side I find far more interesting. There are few individuals as central to that latter segment of crypto as Vitalik Buterin. When he was still just a teenager, Buterin co-founded Ethereum, a decentralized platform whose token Ether is the second most valuable cryptocurrency today, surpassed only by Bitcoin. But the vision behind Ethereum was that the blockchain technology could be used for more than digital money; it could create a sort of digital infrastructure on top of which organizations and companies and applications could be built ostensibly free of centralizing structures like banks and governments. [You can listen to this episode of The Ezra Klein Show on Apple, Spotify, Amazon Music, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.] Over the last decade, Buterin has become arguably the core public intellectual on the nonfinancial side of crypto. His new book, Proof of Stake,ù is a collection of long, thoughtful essays that, taken together, lay out a vision of crypto as a truly transformative technology î one with the potential to revolutionize everything from city governance to voting systems to online identity. I myself have dueling impulses about Buterin s vision. On the one hand, I believe many of our governing systems and institutions are badly in need of the kind of reimagining he is engaged in. On the other hand, Im deeply skeptical of whether the issues Buterin and his ilk are focused on are actually technological problems that blockchains can solve. So this is a conversation that sits squarely within that tension.

10,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/21/opinion/business-economics/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-effective-altruism.html,Opinion | What Stage of Capitalism Is Sam Bankman-Fried? - The New York Times,2022-11-21T20:00:06.000Z,By David Wallace-Wells,"FTX‚Äôs $32 billion valuation was a fantasy, but nobody bothered to look at it closely.","How do you make a multibillion-dollar company disappear in a week? For Sam Bankman-Fried and his crypto exchange FTX, the simple answer is that a leaked balance sheet leads your biggest rival, himself under federal scrutiny, to instigate a sort of ‚Äúbank run‚Äù you cannot possibly cover, exposing billions of dollars in shortfalls you apparently created by riskily investing money that wasn‚Äôt yours. And revealing yourself, in the process, to be a very new kind of financial villain ‚Äî one who pitches not just the prospect of profit but also deliverance from the corrupt speculative system in which you ‚Äúmade‚Äù your ‚Äúbillions.‚Äù But if S.B.F. was just a meme stock ‚Äî his cultural capital inflated by our collective desire to see his profile grow ‚Äî what exactly was the meme? Cryptocurrency is little more than a decade old, and yet it has passed through several reputational phases: first, as the lawless province of black marketeers and hard-core libertarians obsessed with escaping government oversight; then as a speculative market in which many of those people made an astonishing and enviable amount of money; then as an investment sector for adventurous normies who might previously have turned to simple day-trading; then as an ‚Äúasset class‚Äù eyed by big-money investors and establishment banks. It was only at the start of last year‚Äôs N.F.L. season that Matt Damon, unknowingly standing on the precipice of a coming ‚Äúcrypto winter‚Äù in which the value of Bitcoin fell by two-thirds, endorsed Crypto.com and reminded millions of Americans that ‚Äúfortune favors the brave.‚Äù The gold-rush phase for cryptocurrency is over now ‚Äî with the FTX collapse punctuating that crypto winter, a Christmas of malfeasance. The death of FTX has been called crypto‚Äôs ‚ÄúLehman moment,‚Äù but it was not the first such collapse ‚Äî it follows the implosions of Celsius, Three Arrows Capital, Terra and Luna, among many others. But it‚Äôs fitting that Bankman-Fried will now always be remembered as this crypto crash‚Äôs central figure, because he postured as someone who could rewrite not just the rules of the financial system but its morality as well. To investors and legislators, he looked like the potential face of a new era for crypto, poised to legitimize through transparency and regulation what had always been an enormously shady, if often quite lucrative, sector. To progressives, he looked like our kind of oligarch, a sort of boy wonder who seemed capable of conjuring up world-changing billions guiltlessly, effectively out of thin air. And he had promised to give that magic internet money away just as quickly: to Democrats, for whom he was the second-largest donor in the midterm cycle and to whom he had casually promised as much as $1 billion by 2024; to pandemic-prevention policy work; to journalistic start-ups and a whole host of causes affiliated with ‚Äúeffective altruism,‚Äù a movement devoted to doing maximal good in the world. In just three years after its founding, FTX grew from zero to a $32 billion valuation and along the way seemed to provide every progressive millennial a potential sugar daddy. This was a fantasy, as anyone looking closely at the time could have told you. But it was very tempting to believe, and nobody was trying to look all that closely, it turns out ‚Äî not the editors who put him on the covers of Forbes and Fortune; not the traders who trusted him with billions in daily trading volume; not the recipients of his philanthropic pledges, many of which will now go unfulfilled; and most conspicuously, not the investors who handed him millions without seeming to even bother checking the books.

Would I please comment on what it‚Äôs all about, and what‚Äôs going on? Well, I can tell you what it‚Äôs about. What‚Äôs going on is harder to explain. The story so far: Bitcoin, the first and biggest cryptocurrency, was introduced in 2009. It uses an encryption key, similar to those used in hard-to-break codes ‚Äî hence the ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù ‚Äî to establish chains of ownership in tokens that entitle their current holders to ‚Ä¶ well, ownership of those tokens. And nowadays we use Bitcoin to buy houses and cars, pay our bills, make business investments, and more. Oh, wait. We don‚Äôt do any of those things. Twelve years on, cryptocurrencies play almost no role in normal economic activity. Almost the only time we hear about them being used as a means of payment ‚Äî as opposed to speculative trading ‚Äî is in association with illegal activity, like money laundering or the Bitcoin ransom Colonial Pipeline paid to hackers who shut it down. Twelve years is an eon in information technology time. Venmo, which I can use to share restaurant bills, buy fresh fruit at sidewalk kiosks, and much more, was also introduced in 2009. Apple unveiled its first-generation iPad in 2010. Zoom came into use in 2012. By the time a technology gets as old as cryptocurrency, we expect it either to have become part of the fabric of everyday life or to have been given up as a nonstarter. If normal, law-abiding people don‚Äôt use cryptocurrency, it‚Äôs not for lack of effort on the part of crypto boosters. Many highly paid person-hours have been spent trying to find the killer app, the thing that will finally get the masses using Bitcoin, Ethereum or some other brand daily. But I‚Äôve been in numerous meetings with enthusiasts for cryptocurrency and/or blockchain, the concept that underlies it. In such meetings I and others always ask, as politely as we can: ‚ÄúWhat problem does this technology solve? What does it do that other, much cheaper and easier-to-use technologies can‚Äôt do just as well or better?‚Äù I still haven‚Äôt heard a clear answer.

But they are messing with the stock market.,"This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Cryptocurrencies have been around for 12 years now, and for much of that time, they were a fairly easy subcultural fixation to ignore, like SantaCon or the Golden Globes. But in 2021 that became a lot harder to do: Last week the combined value of cryptocurrencies plummeted after six months of breakneck growth, wiping out $1.3 trillion in wealth ‚Äî and causing the rest of the stock market to tumble with it. ‚ÄúAs the world of cryptocurrencies has exploded over the past year, so has its impact on actual companies and therefore financial markets,‚Äù The Times‚Äôs Matt Phillips wrote of the downturn. ‚ÄúAnalysts at JPMorgan recently noted that the market value of cryptocurrencies, as a share of the economy, are larger than the total outstanding amount of subprime real estate debt before the financial crisis.‚Äù Why have cryptocurrencies become so popular, and does their mainstreaming pose a threat to the broader economy? Here‚Äôs what people are saying. What‚Äôs the point of cryptocurrency? All money is, to some degree, an object of faith: A $100 bill is worth what $100 buys only because we believe it is and because that belief is underwritten by the U.S. government. What cryptocurrencies do, in effect, is take the state out of the equation: Instead of a bank, they rely on networks of powerful computers racing to verify transactions, a process that in turn generates more units ‚Äî or ‚Äúcoins‚Äù ‚Äî of currency. Every transaction is recorded through a cryptographic technology called blockchain, a kind of public ledger that is virtually impossible to alter. Bitcoin, the first and still by far the largest cryptocurrency, came online in 2009, and thousands more have since been created. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

3,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/14/opinion/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-flaws.html,Opinion | Bitcoin's Many Flaws - The New York Times,2021-06-14T09:00:07.000Z,By Eswar Prasad,Its value is volatile. Its users aren't as†anonymous as they think. It might be a threat to the environment. And it could be exacerbating inequality.,"Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, has been on a wild ride since its creation in 2009. Earlier this year, the price of one Bitcoin surged to over $60,000, an eightfold increase in 12 months. Then it fell to half that value in just a few weeks. Values of other cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin have risen and fallen even more sharply, often based just on Elon Musk‚Äôs tweets. Even after the recent fall in their prices, the total market value of all cryptocurrencies now exceeds $1.5 trillion, a staggering amount for virtual objects that are nothing more than computer code. Are cryptocurrencies the wave of the future and should you be using and investing in them? And do the massive swings in their prices ‚Äî nearly $1 trillion was wiped off the their total value in May ‚Äî portend trouble for the financial system? Bitcoin was created (by a person or group that remains unidentified to this day) as a way to conduct transactions without the intervention of a trusted third party, such as a central bank or financial institution. Its emergence amid the global financial crisis, which shook trust in banks and even governments, was perfectly timed. Bitcoin enabled transactions using only digital identities, granting users some degree of anonymity. This made Bitcoin the preferred currency for illicit activities, including recent ransomware attacks. It powered the shadowy darknet of illegal online commerce much like PayPal helped the rise of eBay by making payments easier. As it grew in popularity, Bitcoin became cumbersome, slow, and expensive to use. It takes about 10 minutes to validate most transactions using the cryptocurrency and the transaction fee has been at a median of about $20 this year. Bitcoin‚Äôs unstable value has also made it an unviable medium of exchange. It is as though your $10 bill could buy you a beer on one day and a bottle of fine wine on another. Moreover, it has become clear that Bitcoin does not offer true anonymity. The government‚Äôs success in tracking and retrieving part of the Bitcoin ransom paid to the hacking collective DarkSide in the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack has heightened doubts about the security and nontraceability of Bitcoin transactions. While Bitcoin has failed in its stated objectives, it has become a speculative investment. This is puzzling. It has no intrinsic value and is not backed by anything. Bitcoin devotees will tell you that, like gold, its value comes from its scarcity ‚Äî Bitcoin‚Äôs computer algorithm mandates a fixed cap of 21 million digital coins (nearly 19 million have been created so far). But scarcity by itself can hardly be a source of value. Bitcoin investors seem to be relying on the greater fool theory ‚Äî all you need to profit from an investment is to find someone willing to buy the asset at an even higher price.

4,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/opinion/senate-cryptocurrency.html,Opinion | The Way the Senate Melted Down Over Crypto Is Very Revealing - The New York Times,2021-08-12T09:00:19.000Z,By Ezra Klein,It almost derailed the bipartisan infrastructure bill passage.,"For months, there‚Äôs been a debate over what should count as infrastructure. Roads and bridges, sure. But what about preschool and health insurance and child care? Democrats say yes, Republicans say no. With the exception of broadband access, however, there‚Äôs been almost no discussion of the infrastructure underpinning the digital economy. But right at the end, that changed, when a meltdown over cryptocurrency regulation almost derailed the bipartisan infrastructure bill‚Äôs passage in the Senate. I‚Äôm going to try to do a few things here. First, I want to explain why crypto matters, even if you think Bitcoin is just goldbuggery for nerds. The technology is evolving to be much more than a digital currency, and Silicon Valley sees it as the digital infrastructure atop which the next internet will be built. Then I want to trace the fight that consumed the final days of the bill, because this was just an early skirmish in what will be a much longer campaign. [Get more from Ezra Klein by listening to his Opinion podcast, ‚ÄúThe Ezra Klein Show.‚Äù] ‚ÄúCrypto started in 2009 with Bitcoin,‚Äù Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of both Coinbase and Paradigm, a crypto-focused investment firm, told me. ‚ÄúMany people still relate to it as a speculative phenomenon focused around digital money. That was certainly true for the first few years of crypto‚Äôs existence. But now we‚Äôre moving far beyond that.‚Äù Ehrsam described crypto as having three distinct phases. In the first phase, the technology was used to develop digitally native currencies ‚Äî Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin and so on. The cryptocurrency market is now worth around $2 trillion, which is astonishing, given that it didn‚Äôt exist in 2008. Here‚Äôs where it gets complicated. The currencies play a dual role in crypto. They are, in the first place, currencies, and people buy and sell and trade them ‚Äî and occasionally use them to buy and sell and trade goods. But they‚Äôre also the way crypto networks pay for development and upkeep: You get bits of cryptocurrency for adding to the system, and that makes the massive, decentralized computing forces these networks need possible. There‚Äôs a dark side to this: The promise of unlocking bits of cryptocurrency by solving computationally intensive math problems, coupled with the need to log every transaction on countless different computers, is driving the disastrous energy consumption that has made some of the crypto networks a climate threat. According to Digiconomist, Bitcoin and Ethereum together consume about as much electric energy annually as Indonesia. (One way you know the infrastructure bill is not a climate bill is that it completely ignores crypto‚Äôs energy use.) We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Also: R. Kelly's conviction; a new look for the American flag.,"More from our inbox: New Currency? Oh No! R. Kelly‚Äôs Conviction: ‚ÄòA Bittersweet Victory‚Äô Variations on the American Flag Image Credit...The New York Times To the Editor: Re ‚ÄúBitcoin Cosplay Is Getting Real,‚Äù by Binyamin Appelbaum (Sunday Review, Sept. 19): What a sad and sour portrait Mr. Appelbaum paints of Bitcoin. In their brief existence, cybercurrencies like Bitcoin have grown into a $2 trillion market (about the same size as Apple), spawned entire new industries (non-fungible tokens, cybermining), led to a flurry of innovation, and created a cadre of millionaires and billionaires. Financial firms, central banks, regulators, systems designers, investors and national governments are all rethinking ‚Äî as they must ‚Äî the ways in which blockchain-based currency technologies are changing the world around them. Mr. Appelbaum sees none of the excitement and potential of such a massively disruptive innovation. Instead, he hauls out the tired comparison of Bitcoin to the Dutch tulip craze in the 1600s. Four hundred years later tulips are thriving as a robust part of Holland‚Äôs economy. We won‚Äôt need to wait that long to learn if Bitcoin will stand the test of time, but its growth and institutionalization in the space of just a few years strongly suggest that it‚Äôs here to stay. David Sarokin Washington The writer is the author of ‚ÄúThe Corporation: Its History and Future.‚Äù To the Editor: Binyamin Appelbaum writes that modern blockchain tokens are ‚Äúmostly useless.‚Äù These tokens, in fact, have some very common and well-reported uses: facilitating fraud, money laundering and illicit financial transactions. Blockchain is best understood as a worldwide criminal enterprise masquerading as an economic bubble. Digital blockchain tokens have no legitimate use, but they have plenty of illegitimate ones. While the people profiting off these sketchy transactions are now trying to buy political influence and mainstream media coverage, we can only hope governments will eventually see through their charade and criminalize cryptocurrency‚Äôs manufacture and use. Until this happens we should expect blockchain-enabled fraud and criminality to get worse and worse until, like a boil, it ruptures. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

In certain ways, I‚Äôm an optimist: I think these technologies matter, and many of them will work. In other ways, I‚Äôm a skeptic: I‚Äôm unconvinced that their wide adoption will lead to the glittering, decentralized digital world that many crypto proponents imagine. So this is a crypto conversation that goes way beyond Bitcoin. It‚Äôs about what will happen when we build the foundation for truly digital economies, with digital money, digital goods, and digital ownership. It‚Äôs about technologies that could unlock a renaissance of creativity or an orgy of commercialization. Or both. And it‚Äôs about whether we are mistaking problems of power for problems of technology, and what might happen if we fix the technologies without changing the power structures. As everyone in this debate agrees, we made a lot of mistakes with the internet we have. How do we avoid them on the internet we‚Äôre building? [You can listen to this episode of ‚ÄúThe Ezra Klein Show‚Äù on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.] My guest today is Katie Haun. Haun is a general partner at the venture firm A16Z, also known as Andreessen-Horowitz. She‚Äôs a former Supreme Court clerk and federal prosecutor who has focused on cybercrime and prosecuted corrupt agents involved in Silk Road, the first big darknet market. So she saw the dark side of crypto first, and now, at A16Z, she‚Äôs a leader of one of the biggest crypto venture funds there is. So this is a conversation about the world crypto might create, conducted with as little technical jargon as we could manage. Enjoy! I also want to note that this will be the last episode I host until January. I‚Äôm going on paternity leave for the next few months, and we‚Äôre going to have an absolutely all-star lineup of guest hosts while I‚Äôm gone.

7,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/opinion/bitcoin-etf-trading.html,Opinion | The First Bitcoin-Related Fund Makes Its Stock Market Debut - The New York Times,2021-10-25T19:23:13.000Z,By Jay Caspian Kang,What does it mean now that cryptocurrency has joined proper society?,"Bitcoin, which pushed past $66,000 last week, setting all-time price highs, has come a long way since January 2009, when a programmer with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto introduced the cryptocurrency that would become a religion for some, a nuisance for others, and a looming threat to both the environment and the financial markets. It‚Äôs always a bit of a fool‚Äôs errand to try to explain why cryptocurrency prices go up or down, but last week‚Äôs rally coincided with the stock market debut of the first Bitcoin-related exchange-traded fund available to American investors. The push for a Bitcoin ETF has been going on for years. Most notably, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twins who were memorialized in ‚ÄúThe Social Network,‚Äù tried to launch a cryptocurrency ETF in 2018 and were denied by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Winklevosses, who own the Gemini exchange, one of the most popular places where investors can buy and sell cryptocurrencies, believed that an ETF would legitimize Bitcoin and open up the opportunity for big money investors to boost the price. The ETF was supposed to be Bitcoin‚Äôs debutante ball. The suitors, in this case, would be pension funds, investment banks and even retail investors who wanted a safer, friendlier way to cash in on cryptocurrency. Now that Bitcoin is finally taking the stage as a member of society, it‚Äôs worth asking whether this gambit will pay off and how it might change how we think about big, bad Bitcoin. I started dabbling in Bitcoin in 2017, back when prices were somewhere around $3,000 a coin. (Disclosure: I own about 5 percent of one Bitcoin ‚Äî each coin can be broken down infinitely.) The spirit around cryptocurrencies back then was far more anarchic and apocalyptic than it is today, which interested me because my own politics tend to run in the opposite direction. And I‚Äôm generally drawn to people with big, if sometimes stupid, ideas. There were plans for Bitcoin utopias in the deserts of Nevada, sovereignty movements by groups calling themselves ‚ÄúThe United States of Bitcoin,‚Äù and pages and pages of speculation on how the blockchain, the ledger-like technology that powers cryptocurrency, would quickly change every industry on the planet. As with so many nascent communities, Bitcoin had evangelists and detractors. The book ‚ÄúThe Bitcoin Standard,‚Äù by Saifedean Ammous, took on sacred properties, like a Talmudic text. At the same time, the economist Nouriel Roubini repeatedly proclaimed that Bitcoin would go to zero and told Congress that it was the ‚Äúmother or father of all scams.‚Äù In those years, there was also a growing divide between believers. The so-called Bitcoin maximalists supported the extreme libertarian principles of the Austrian School of Economics, full decentralization of economies and the end of what they called ‚Äúfiat currency.‚Äù More pragmatic Bitcoin assimilationists, such as the Winklevosses, wanted to clean up cryptocurrencies and weed out the crazies, to get it in front of wealthy investors.

Besides suddenly stepping down as chief executive and chairman of Twitter, he made waves over at his other day job, leading the payments company he co-founded called Square, and changed its corporate name to Block. This is not just fun with shapes; the new name is meant to refer to the blockchain. (Do not make me explain what the blockchain is.) Not to get all meta on you as ù the company tweeted, making an allusion to another recent corporate name change. Block references the neighborhood blocks where we find our sellers, a blockchain, block parties full of music, obstacles to overcome, a section of code, building blocks, and of course, tungsten cubes. Tungsten cubes? For those who are not in the know, these are dense metal blocks (get it??!?) that have become an obsession among the cryptorati. (Look, I just made up a word!) These folks like to hold the cubes and have been buying them like there is no tomorrow. A two-inch tungsten cube weighs over five pounds, so it‚Äôs like a toddler toy for grown-ups. Cooool. Speaking of which, all these seemingly separate moves seem to indicate that Twitter could itself be on the block (ha) soon enough, as Scott Galloway posited on the weekly Twitter Spaces chat I co-host with Casey Newton of Platformer. I have been writing about buyout interest for a while, including in 2016 when Salesforce, Google and even Disney kicked Twitter tires. As I noted back then: Why not take a gander, given the huge trove of data that Twitter sits atop globally and its unique worldwide digital distribution system? While company execs have been unable to grow the business, many think a link with a larger entity would spur Twitter potential.ù That you could write that very same sentence today says it all, since Twitter stock has been dead in the water for years. Shares sold for around $42 in November 2013, and today they are trading for around, you guessed it, $42. This is even as other tech companies valuations have soared during the pandemic.

What's Happening to Money? - The New York Times,2021-12-10T10:00:26.000Z,By Peter Coy,It is not just about the demise of coins and dollar bills. It is also about society s faith in the very idea of money.,"I felt two unexpected emotions ‚Äî pity and guilt ‚Äî one day recently while I was packing loose pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters into paper rolls to take to the bank. Coins, which were a big part of my childhood, have come to seem like inconvenient relics, as anachronistic as my grandfather‚Äôs stamp collection. All over the world, people are abandoning old forms of money and adopting new ones, like cryptocurrency, faster than our brains and customs can process. ‚ÄúWe are at an interesting juncture,‚Äù Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist, told me. ‚ÄúIt is a period of a great degree of concern about what happens to traditional forms of money and whether these technological developments we see around us are going to benefit us in some way or just create more disruption and turmoil.‚Äù In much of Europe and East Asia you can go for weeks without touching paper money or coins. In 2013, a bank robber in Sweden was thwarted because the bank he targeted didn‚Äôt have any money to steal: The branch was a cashless location. Five years later, Cecilia Skingsley, at the time the deputy governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, told Financial Times, ‚ÄúIf you extrapolate current trends, the last note will have been handed back to the Riksbank by 2030.‚Äù The trend is the same, though not as advanced, in the United States. The share of Americans preferring to pay with cash fell to 18 percent in 2020, from 27 percent in 2016, according to a Federal Reserve survey, a trend accelerated by the pandemic. Americans ages 25 to 34 are less than half as likely to use cash as those 65 and older. Last year, the New York City Council had to pass a bill requiring that food and retail establishments accept cash or face a $1,000 fine, in order to make sure people who don‚Äôt have credit or debit cards ‚Äî people who are more likely to be poor, elderly or homeless ‚Äî could continue to shop.

10,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/10/opinion/vaccine-polls-covid.html,Opinion | Are Vaccine Polls Flawed? - The New York Times,2021-12-10T20:59:14.000Z,By Peter Coy,Researchers say that two large surveys are not representative.,"Two widely followed surveys ‚Äúsignificantly overestimated‚Äù how many American adults got their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine last spring, says an article in the scientific journal Nature that was published online on Wednesday. The surveys have large numbers of participants but nevertheless aren‚Äôt representative of the U.S. adult population, the article says. This flaw is a symptom of a bigger problem, which is the belief that asking lots of people to respond to a survey can make up for deficiencies in its design. It‚Äôs what one of the Nature authors, the statistician Xiao-Li Meng, calls the big data paradox. ‚ÄúThe more the data, the surer we fool ourselves,‚Äù he wrote in 2018 in The Annals of Applied Statistics. The Nature article analyzes two surveys of Covid-19 vaccine uptake: One is the Delphi-Facebook survey, which gathers about 250,000 responses a week and which its backers describe as unmatched in ‚Äúdetail and scale‚Äù for a public health emergency. The other is the Census Bureau‚Äôs Household Pulse Survey, which gathers about 75,000 responses every two weeks. The article says that earlier this year the Delphi-Facebook survey overestimated the uptake of Covid-19 vaccines by 17 percentage points (70 percent versus the actual 53 percent), while the Census Bureau‚Äôs Household Pulse Survey overestimated the uptake by about 14 percentage points. Those are big misses, far bigger than the surveys‚Äô own estimates of their margins of error. The reason we know the surveys were wrong is that we can compare their estimates for Jan. 9 to May 19 of this year with verified records of vaccinations for that period that were published on May 26 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A much smaller survey conducted by Axios and Ipsos was off by only 4 percentage points, the Nature article says. That survey is based on an online panel with only about 1,000 responses per week, but it uses best practices for obtaining a representative cross-section. By one measure the Delphi-Facebook survey produced results that are no better than a simple random sample of just 10 people, the authors of the Nature article write. ‚ÄúOur central message,‚Äù they conclude, ‚Äúis that data quality matters more than data quantity, and that compensating the former with the latter is a mathematically provable losing proposition.‚Äù We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Would I please comment on what it‚Äôs all about, and what‚Äôs going on? Well, I can tell you what it‚Äôs about. What‚Äôs going on is harder to explain. The story so far: Bitcoin, the first and biggest cryptocurrency, was introduced in 2009. It uses an encryption key, similar to those used in hard-to-break codes ‚Äî hence the ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù ‚Äî to establish chains of ownership in tokens that entitle their current holders to ‚Ä¶ well, ownership of those tokens. And nowadays we use Bitcoin to buy houses and cars, pay our bills, make business investments, and more. Oh, wait. We don‚Äôt do any of those things. Twelve years on, cryptocurrencies play almost no role in normal economic activity. Almost the only time we hear about them being used as a means of payment ‚Äî as opposed to speculative trading ‚Äî is in association with illegal activity, like money laundering or the Bitcoin ransom Colonial Pipeline paid to hackers who shut it down. Twelve years is an eon in information technology time. Venmo, which I can use to share restaurant bills, buy fresh fruit at sidewalk kiosks, and much more, was also introduced in 2009. Apple unveiled its first-generation iPad in 2010. Zoom came into use in 2012. By the time a technology gets as old as cryptocurrency, we expect it either to have become part of the fabric of everyday life or to have been given up as a nonstarter. If normal, law-abiding people don‚Äôt use cryptocurrency, it‚Äôs not for lack of effort on the part of crypto boosters. Many highly paid person-hours have been spent trying to find the killer app, the thing that will finally get the masses using Bitcoin, Ethereum or some other brand daily. But I‚Äôve been in numerous meetings with enthusiasts for cryptocurrency and/or blockchain, the concept that underlies it. In such meetings I and others always ask, as politely as we can: ‚ÄúWhat problem does this technology solve? What does it do that other, much cheaper and easier-to-use technologies can‚Äôt do just as well or better?‚Äù I still haven‚Äôt heard a clear answer.

But they are messing with the stock market.,"This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Cryptocurrencies have been around for 12 years now, and for much of that time, they were a fairly easy subcultural fixation to ignore, like SantaCon or the Golden Globes. But in 2021 that became a lot harder to do: Last week the combined value of cryptocurrencies plummeted after six months of breakneck growth, wiping out $1.3 trillion in wealth ‚Äî and causing the rest of the stock market to tumble with it. ‚ÄúAs the world of cryptocurrencies has exploded over the past year, so has its impact on actual companies and therefore financial markets,‚Äù The Times‚Äôs Matt Phillips wrote of the downturn. ‚ÄúAnalysts at JPMorgan recently noted that the market value of cryptocurrencies, as a share of the economy, are larger than the total outstanding amount of subprime real estate debt before the financial crisis.‚Äù Why have cryptocurrencies become so popular, and does their mainstreaming pose a threat to the broader economy? Here‚Äôs what people are saying. What‚Äôs the point of cryptocurrency? All money is, to some degree, an object of faith: A $100 bill is worth what $100 buys only because we believe it is and because that belief is underwritten by the U.S. government. What cryptocurrencies do, in effect, is take the state out of the equation: Instead of a bank, they rely on networks of powerful computers racing to verify transactions, a process that in turn generates more units ‚Äî or ‚Äúcoins‚Äù ‚Äî of currency. Every transaction is recorded through a cryptographic technology called blockchain, a kind of public ledger that is virtually impossible to alter. Bitcoin, the first and still by far the largest cryptocurrency, came online in 2009, and thousands more have since been created. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Its users aren't as¬†anonymous as they think. It might be a threat to the environment. And it could be exacerbating inequality.,"Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, has been on a wild ride since its creation in 2009. Earlier this year, the price of one Bitcoin surged to over $60,000, an eightfold increase in 12 months. Then it fell to half that value in just a few weeks. Values of other cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin have risen and fallen even more sharply, often based just on Elon Musk‚Äôs tweets. Even after the recent fall in their prices, the total market value of all cryptocurrencies now exceeds $1.5 trillion, a staggering amount for virtual objects that are nothing more than computer code. Are cryptocurrencies the wave of the future and should you be using and investing in them? And do the massive swings in their prices ‚Äî nearly $1 trillion was wiped off the their total value in May ‚Äî portend trouble for the financial system? Bitcoin was created (by a person or group that remains unidentified to this day) as a way to conduct transactions without the intervention of a trusted third party, such as a central bank or financial institution. Its emergence amid the global financial crisis, which shook trust in banks and even governments, was perfectly timed. Bitcoin enabled transactions using only digital identities, granting users some degree of anonymity. This made Bitcoin the preferred currency for illicit activities, including recent ransomware attacks. It powered the shadowy darknet of illegal online commerce much like PayPal helped the rise of eBay by making payments easier. As it grew in popularity, Bitcoin became cumbersome, slow, and expensive to use. It takes about 10 minutes to validate most transactions using the cryptocurrency and the transaction fee has been at a median of about $20 this year. Bitcoin‚Äôs unstable value has also made it an unviable medium of exchange. It is as though your $10 bill could buy you a beer on one day and a bottle of fine wine on another. Moreover, it has become clear that Bitcoin does not offer true anonymity. The government‚Äôs success in tracking and retrieving part of the Bitcoin ransom paid to the hacking collective DarkSide in the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack has heightened doubts about the security and nontraceability of Bitcoin transactions. While Bitcoin has failed in its stated objectives, it has become a speculative investment. This is puzzling. It has no intrinsic value and is not backed by anything. Bitcoin devotees will tell you that, like gold, its value comes from its scarcity ‚Äî Bitcoin‚Äôs computer algorithm mandates a fixed cap of 21 million digital coins (nearly 19 million have been created so far). But scarcity by itself can hardly be a source of value. Bitcoin investors seem to be relying on the greater fool theory ‚Äî all you need to profit from an investment is to find someone willing to buy the asset at an even higher price.

4,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/opinion/senate-cryptocurrency.html,Opinion | The Way the Senate Melted Down Over Crypto Is Very Revealing - The New York Times,2021-08-12T09:00:19.000Z,By Ezra Klein,It almost derailed the bipartisan infrastructure bills passage.,"For months, there‚Äôs been a debate over what should count as infrastructure. Roads and bridges, sure. But what about preschool and health insurance and child care? Democrats say yes, Republicans say no. With the exception of broadband access, however, there‚Äôs been almost no discussion of the infrastructure underpinning the digital economy. But right at the end, that changed, when a meltdown over cryptocurrency regulation almost derailed the bipartisan infrastructure bill‚Äôs passage in the Senate. I‚Äôm going to try to do a few things here. First, I want to explain why crypto matters, even if you think Bitcoin is just goldbuggery for nerds. The technology is evolving to be much more than a digital currency, and Silicon Valley sees it as the digital infrastructure atop which the next internet will be built. Then I want to trace the fight that consumed the final days of the bill, because this was just an early skirmish in what will be a much longer campaign. [Get more from Ezra Klein by listening to his Opinion podcast, ‚ÄúThe Ezra Klein Show.‚Äù] ‚ÄúCrypto started in 2009 with Bitcoin,‚Äù Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of both Coinbase and Paradigm, a crypto-focused investment firm, told me. ‚ÄúMany people still relate to it as a speculative phenomenon focused around digital money. That was certainly true for the first few years of crypto‚Äôs existence. But now we‚Äôre moving far beyond that.‚Äù Ehrsam described crypto as having three distinct phases. In the first phase, the technology was used to develop digitally native currencies ‚Äî Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin and so on. The cryptocurrency market is now worth around $2 trillion, which is astonishing, given that it didn‚Äôt exist in 2008. Here‚Äôs where it gets complicated. The currencies play a dual role in crypto. They are, in the first place, currencies, and people buy and sell and trade them ‚Äî and occasionally use them to buy and sell and trade goods. But they‚Äôre also the way crypto networks pay for development and upkeep: You get bits of cryptocurrency for adding to the system, and that makes the massive, decentralized computing forces these networks need possible. There‚Äôs a dark side to this: The promise of unlocking bits of cryptocurrency by solving computationally intensive math problems, coupled with the need to log every transaction on countless different computers, is driving the disastrous energy consumption that has made some of the crypto networks a climate threat. According to Digiconomist, Bitcoin and Ethereum together consume about as much electric energy annually as Indonesia. (One way you know the infrastructure bill is not a climate bill is that it completely ignores crypto‚Äôs energy use.) We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Also: R. Kelly's conviction; a new look for the American flag.,"More from our inbox: New Currency? Oh No! R. Kelly‚Äôs Conviction: ‚ÄòA Bittersweet Victory‚Äô Variations on the American Flag Image Credit...The New York Times To the Editor: Re ‚ÄúBitcoin Cosplay Is Getting Real,‚Äù by Binyamin Appelbaum (Sunday Review, Sept. 19): What a sad and sour portrait Mr. Appelbaum paints of Bitcoin. In their brief existence, cybercurrencies like Bitcoin have grown into a $2 trillion market (about the same size as Apple), spawned entire new industries (non-fungible tokens, cybermining), led to a flurry of innovation, and created a cadre of millionaires and billionaires. Financial firms, central banks, regulators, systems designers, investors and national governments are all rethinking ‚Äî as they must ‚Äî the ways in which blockchain-based currency technologies are changing the world around them. Mr. Appelbaum sees none of the excitement and potential of such a massively disruptive innovation. Instead, he hauls out the tired comparison of Bitcoin to the Dutch tulip craze in the 1600s. Four hundred years later tulips are thriving as a robust part of Holland‚Äôs economy. We won‚Äôt need to wait that long to learn if Bitcoin will stand the test of time, but its growth and institutionalization in the space of just a few years strongly suggest that it‚Äôs here to stay. David Sarokin Washington The writer is the author of ‚ÄúThe Corporation: Its History and Future.‚Äù To the Editor: Binyamin Appelbaum writes that modern blockchain tokens are ‚Äúmostly useless.‚Äù These tokens, in fact, have some very common and well-reported uses: facilitating fraud, money laundering and illicit financial transactions. Blockchain is best understood as a worldwide criminal enterprise masquerading as an economic bubble. Digital blockchain tokens have no legitimate use, but they have plenty of illegitimate ones. While the people profiting off these sketchy transactions are now trying to buy political influence and mainstream media coverage, we can only hope governments will eventually see through their charade and criminalize cryptocurrency‚Äôs manufacture and use. Until this happens we should expect blockchain-enabled fraud and criminality to get worse and worse until, like a boil, it ruptures. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

In certain ways, I‚Äôm an optimist: I think these technologies matter, and many of them will work. In other ways, I‚Äôm a skeptic: I‚Äôm unconvinced that their wide adoption will lead to the glittering, decentralized digital world that many crypto proponents imagine. So this is a crypto conversation that goes way beyond Bitcoin. It‚Äôs about what will happen when we build the foundation for truly digital economies, with digital money, digital goods, and digital ownership. It‚Äôs about technologies that could unlock a renaissance of creativity or an orgy of commercialization. Or both. And it‚Äôs about whether we are mistaking problems of power for problems of technology, and what might happen if we fix the technologies without changing the power structures. As everyone in this debate agrees, we made a lot of mistakes with the internet we have. How do we avoid them on the internet we‚Äôre building? [You can listen to this episode of ‚ÄúThe Ezra Klein Show‚Äù on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.] My guest today is Katie Haun. Haun is a general partner at the venture firm A16Z, also known as Andreessen-Horowitz. She‚Äôs a former Supreme Court clerk and federal prosecutor who has focused on cybercrime and prosecuted corrupt agents involved in Silk Road, the first big darknet market. So she saw the dark side of crypto first, and now, at A16Z, she‚Äôs a leader of one of the biggest crypto venture funds there is. So this is a conversation about the world crypto might create, conducted with as little technical jargon as we could manage. Enjoy! I also want to note that this will be the last episode I host until January. I‚Äôm going on paternity leave for the next few months, and we‚Äôre going to have an absolutely all-star lineup of guest hosts while I‚Äôm gone. That lineup will include Jamelle Bouie, Ross Douthat, Tressie McMillan Cottom, Nicole Hemmer, Heather McGhee, David Brooks, Julia Galef and the one and only Rog√© Karma. I‚Äôm excited to be a listener, and trust me, you should be, too.

7,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/opinion/bitcoin-etf-trading.html,Opinion | The First Bitcoin-Related Fund Makes Its Stock Market Debut - The New York Times,2021-10-25T19:23:13.000Z,By Jay Caspian Kang,What does it mean now that cryptocurrency has joined proper society?,"Bitcoin, which pushed past $66,000 last week, setting all-time price highs, has come a long way since January 2009, when a programmer with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto introduced the cryptocurrency that would become a religion for some, a nuisance for others, and a looming threat to both the environment and the financial markets. It‚Äôs always a bit of a fool‚Äôs errand to try to explain why cryptocurrency prices go up or down, but last week‚Äôs rally coincided with the stock market debut of the first Bitcoin-related exchange-traded fund available to American investors. The push for a Bitcoin ETF has been going on for years. Most notably, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twins who were memorialized in ‚ÄúThe Social Network,‚Äù tried to launch a cryptocurrency ETF in 2018 and were denied by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Winklevosses, who own the Gemini exchange, one of the most popular places where investors can buy and sell cryptocurrencies, believed that an ETF would legitimize Bitcoin and open up the opportunity for big money investors to boost the price. The ETF was supposed to be Bitcoin‚Äôs debutante ball. The suitors, in this case, would be pension funds, investment banks and even retail investors who wanted a safer, friendlier way to cash in on cryptocurrency. Now that Bitcoin is finally taking the stage as a member of society, it‚Äôs worth asking whether this gambit will pay off and how it might change how we think about big, bad Bitcoin. I started dabbling in Bitcoin in 2017, back when prices were somewhere around $3,000 a coin. (Disclosure: I own about 5 percent of one Bitcoin ‚Äî each coin can be broken down infinitely.) The spirit around cryptocurrencies back then was far more anarchic and apocalyptic than it is today, which interested me because my own politics tend to run in the opposite direction. And I‚Äôm generally drawn to people with big, if sometimes stupid, ideas. There were plans for Bitcoin utopias in the deserts of Nevada, sovereignty movements by groups calling themselves ‚ÄúThe United States of Bitcoin,‚Äù and pages and pages of speculation on how the blockchain, the ledger-like technology that powers cryptocurrency, would quickly change every industry on the planet. As with so many nascent communities, Bitcoin had evangelists and detractors. The book ‚ÄúThe Bitcoin Standard,‚Äù by Saifedean Ammous, took on sacred properties, like a Talmudic text. At the same time, the economist Nouriel Roubini repeatedly proclaimed that Bitcoin would go to zero and told Congress that it was the ‚Äúmother or father of all scams.‚Äù In those years, there was also a growing divide between believers. The so-called Bitcoin maximalists supported the extreme libertarian principles of the Austrian School of Economics, full decentralization of economies and the end of what they called ‚Äúfiat currency.‚Äù More pragmatic Bitcoin assimilationists, such as the Winklevosses, wanted to clean up cryptocurrencies and weed out the crazies, to get it in front of wealthy investors.

8,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/02/opinion/twitter-remote-work.html,Opinion | Jack Dorsey Steps Down and Other Silicon Valley Transitions - The New York Times,2021-12-02T23:00:04.000Z,By Kara Swisher,"Twitter s new boss needs to boost the company s value, or someone else will.","There‚Äôs been a whirlwind of commentary about all the changes at Twitter, and especially around its persistently quirky co-founder Jack Dorsey (whose world I am dubbing the Jackaverse). Besides suddenly stepping down as chief executive and chairman of Twitter, he made waves over at his other day job, leading the payments company he co-founded called Square, and changed its corporate name to Block. This is not just fun with shapes; the new name is meant to refer to the blockchain. (Do not make me explain what the blockchain is.) ‚ÄúNot to get all meta on you ‚Ä¶,‚Äù the company tweeted, making an allusion to another recent corporate name change. ‚Äú‚ÄòBlock‚Äô references the neighborhood blocks where we find our sellers, a blockchain, block parties full of music, obstacles to overcome, a section of code, building blocks, and of course, tungsten cubes.‚Äù Tungsten cubes? For those who are not in the know, these are dense metal blocks (get it??!?) that have become an obsession among the cryptorati. (Look, I just made up a word!) These folks like to hold the cubes and have been buying them like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. A two-inch tungsten cube weighs over five pounds, so it‚Äôs like a toddler toy for grown-ups. Cooool. Speaking of which, all these seemingly separate moves seem to indicate that Twitter could itself be on the block (ha) soon enough, as Scott Galloway posited on the weekly Twitter Spaces chat I co-host with Casey Newton of Platformer. I have been writing about buyout interest for a while, including in 2016 when Salesforce, Google and even Disney kicked Twitter‚Äôs tires. As I noted back then: ‚ÄúWhy not take a gander, given the huge trove of data that Twitter sits atop globally and its unique worldwide digital distribution system? While company execs have been unable to grow the business, many think a link with a larger entity would spur Twitter‚Äôs potential.‚Äù That you could write that very same sentence today says it all, since Twitter stock has been dead in the water for years. Shares sold for around $42 in November 2013, and today they are trading for around, you guessed it, $42. This is even as other tech companies‚Äô valuations have soared during the pandemic.

What's Happening to Money? - The New York Times,2021-12-10T10:00:26.000Z,By Peter Coy,It‚Äôs not just about the demise of coins and dollar bills. It‚Äôs also about society‚Äôs faith in the very idea of money.,"I felt two unexpected emotions "" pity and guilt î one day recently while I was packing loose pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters into paper rolls to take to the bank. Coins, which were a big part of my childhood, have come to seem like inconvenient relics, as anachronistic as my grandfather stamp collection. All over the world, people are abandoning old forms of money and adopting new ones, like cryptocurrency, faster than our brains and customs can process. ‚ÄúWe are at an interesting juncture,‚Äù Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist, told me. ‚ÄúIt is a period of a great degree of concern about what happens to traditional forms of money and whether these technological developments we see around us are going to benefit us in some way or just create more disruption and turmoil.‚Äù In much of Europe and East Asia you can go for weeks without touching paper money or coins. In 2013, a bank robber in Sweden was thwarted because the bank he targeted didn‚Äôt have any money to steal: The branch was a cashless location. Five years later, Cecilia Skingsley, at the time the deputy governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, told Financial Times, ‚ÄúIf you extrapolate current trends, the last note will have been handed back to the Riksbank by 2030.‚Äù The trend is the same, though not as advanced, in the United States. The share of Americans preferring to pay with cash fell to 18 percent in 2020, from 27 percent in 2016, according to a Federal Reserve survey, a trend accelerated by the pandemic. Americans ages 25 to 34 are less than half as likely to use cash as those 65 and older. Last year, the New York City Council had to pass a bill requiring that food and retail establishments accept cash or face a $1,000 fine, in order to make sure people who don‚Äôt have credit or debit cards ‚Äî people who are more likely to be poor, elderly or homeless ‚Äî could continue to shop. There are similar rules in Philadelphia, San Francisco, Massachusetts and New Jersey. It‚Äôs a bad sign for a means of payment when the government has to force people to accept it.
