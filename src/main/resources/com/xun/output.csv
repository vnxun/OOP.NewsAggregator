Many people began to leave  fearing that Israel was moving ahead with its long-planned invasion of Rafah  despite stiff international pressure. The Israeli military began dropping leaflets in eastern Rafah telling people to move to what it called a humanitarian zone to the north  and said it would also notify people by text messages  phone calls and broadcasts in Arabic  and on Monday night  the Israeli military carried out another round of what it called “targeted strikes” in Rafah against Hamas.

A military spokesman would not say when troops might enter the crowded city  but described the evacuation as part of Israel’s plans to dismantle Hamas and to free hostages taken on Oct. 7. Hours after the evacuation order  the political leader of Hamas  Ismail Haniyeh  issued a statement that the group had accepted a new cease-fire proposal from Qatar and Egypt  which have acted as intermediaries in peace talks. The group and Israeli officials said it was not referring to the proposal that Israel recently agreed to  leaving the conflict unresolved.

But even as the security situation worsens and millions of Haitians go hungry  a military-style deployment that is estimated to cost $600 million has just a fraction of the funding required. Biden administration officials would not say whether a precise date for the deployment date had been set. The Kenyan government did not respond to requests for comment. Several military flights  including at least seven from Charleston Air Force Base in South Carolina  have landed at Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince  the capital  in the past week  according to the U.S. Southern Command. Contractors were being flown in to help secure the airport before building a base of operations there for the international security force. More planes carrying construction contractors and equipment were expected in the coming days. “The deployment of the multinational security support mission in Haiti is urgent  and we’re doing all we can to advance that goal ” Brian A. Nichols  assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs  told reporters last week. “Every day that goes by is a lost opportunity to provide greater security for the Haitian people.

Gangs have shut down the airport; looted seaports  public buildings and shops; and attacked nearly a dozen police stations. Roads are blocked  cutting off the food supply  and 4 600 inmates were freed after prisons were attacked. The prime minister  Ariel Henry  is stranded in Puerto Rico while gang members wreak havoc  demand his resignation and hold up dozens of trucks filled with World Food Program food shipments. A state of emergency around Port-au-Prince  the capital  was extended another month. With the government on the verge of collapse  the United States and Caribbean nations are working to come up with a resolution — including a plan for a transitional government — that would restore some semblance of order to the troubled nation and allow Mr. Henry to return home. Who are the gangs and what do they want? Experts estimate that up to 200 gangs operate in Haiti  about 20 of them in Port-au-Prince. They range from small groups of a few dozen young men who share pistols to crews of roughly 1 500 men with weekly salaries and automatic weapons who belong to hierarchal organizations with bosses. Two main gang federations  G-Pèp and the G-9 Family  control many of the poorest neighborhoods in the capital. The criminal groups and their allies sometimes collude  but more often clash.

A heat wave has scorched Mexico in recent days  bringing temperatures in multiple states into the triple digits. Mexico City on Tuesday reached a high of 92 degrees Fahrenheit  the hottest temperature recorded there on May 7 in over 20 years. Mexico’s energy authority  Cenace  announced a state of emergency for the national grid early Tuesday evening  meaning that available power had dropped below adequate levels. It said less than an hour later that the system had returned to normal. But local news media outlets reported on blackouts in municipalities across the country throughout the evening. Social media users uploaded photos and videos of darkened city skylines. Local officials confirmed several blackouts in the state of Mexico  including in San Mateo Atenco and Metepec  near Mexico City. And during a blackout in the city of Nuevo Laredo  near the Texas border  they asked people to avoid driving. In a statement  the national energy agency attributed the electricity shortage on Tuesday afternoon to a series of factors  including a drop in wind and solar power generation. Some power plants were also offline at the time  it said. The statement did not mention the heat wave. An increase in nighttime demand later required rolling power interruptions across Mexico  the agency said. Electricity was gradually being restored starting at about 8 p.m.  in a process that was expected to last until 11 p.m. Mexico has experienced blackouts before  including during extreme weather events  such as hurricanes or heat waves. During power failures in the country last June  local officials reported hundreds of heat-related deaths even as federal and state governments underplayed them.","World","Not related to Blockchain"

Powerful new technologies present a more urgent risk.","There are two distinct factions of parents on TikTok: those who will crack eggs over their kids’ heads for likes and those who are trying desperately to make sure the internet doesn’t know who their children are. Listen to This Article For the 35-year-old TikTok star who posts under the name Kodye Elyse  an uncomfortable online experience made her stop including her three children on her social media. A video she posted in 2020 of her young daughter dancing attracted millions of views and creepy comments from strange men. (She requested that The New York Times not print her full name because she and her children have been doxxed in the past.) “It’s kind of like ‘The Truman Show’ on the internet ” said Kodye Elyse  who has four million followers on TikTok and posts about her work as a cosmetic tattoo artist and her experiences as a single mother. “You never know who’s looking.” After that experience  she scrubbed her children’s images from the internet. She tracked down all of her online accounts  on sites such as Facebook and Pinterest  and deleted them or made them private. She has since joined the clamorous camp of TikTokers encouraging fellow parents not to post about their children publicly. But in September  she discovered her efforts hadn’t been entirely successful. Kodye Elyse used PimEyes  a startling search engine that finds photos of a person on the internet within seconds using facial recognition technology. When she uploaded a photo of her 7-year-old son  the results included an image of him she had never seen before. She needed a $29.99 subscription to see where the image had come from.

The speculation has arisen because the fund  the $59 billion Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust — more commonly known as BREIT — has managed to keep an “appraised” value of its assets that far exceeds virtually every other real estate fund. Many rivals have fallen in value  some quite dramatically  in the face of high interest rates and a flagging property market. BREIT’s performance has floated above its competition  and it has boasted a 10.5 percent annual return since its 2017 debut. The debate over the fund’s impressive performance has taken on greater significance  and the criticism has grown louder  because of how Blackstone determines the appraised value of its assets  DealBook’s Andrew Ross Sorkin and Michael de la Merced report. Many major firms rely on a third-party appraiser to determine the worth of a fund’s assets  in part so investors can trust that the appraised value is accurate and not unduly influenced by the firms. (Those appraisals help to determine a firm’s management fees: The higher the appraisal value  the higher the fees.) Blackstone appears to do it differently. While it uses a third-party appraiser and an outside auditor  the firm has the final say on the appraised value of its own assets. Blackstone is open about its approach. From a recent prospectus: “These assumptions are determined by the Adviser  and reviewed by our independent valuation advisor.” While Blackstone discloses how it determines the final valuation  some on Wall Street have questioned how much latitude firms should have in appraising their own assets.

A spokesman for Alvin L. Bragg  the Manhattan district attorney  said prosecutors planned to drop their case against Mr. Cenat and two other men  Denzel Dennis and Muktar Din  in exchange for the apology and $57 000 in restitution. Mr. Cenat paid $55 000 of the restitution total  which went to the Union Square Partnership to cover landscaping and other costs  the district attorney’s office said. Mr. Dennis and Mr. Din paid the balance. Mr. Cenat posted the apology on his Snapchat account on Tuesday  and Mr. Bragg’s spokeswoman  M’Niyah Lynn  said the prosecution would be dropped once the apology had been online for 24 hours. Mr. Dennis and Mr. Din were expected to post the apology as well. Mr. Cenat  noting that he is from New York  wrote in the apology that what began as a promotional event had quickly turned into “an unsafe situation for the people who live and work in the neighborhood  first responders and my followers that attended the event.” “It was never my intent for it to get so out of hand ” he added  “and I have learned a very valuable lesson that social media is a very powerful tool to do good  but it can also cause dangerous  unwanted situations if it is not used properly.” The Union Square episode  which began shortly after 3 p.m. on Aug. 4 and lasted several hours  resulted in 65 arrests (nearly half of them of underage youths); injuries to police officers and some of those in the crowd; and damage to food carts  police vehicles and stores  officials said. The events began when Mr. Cenat  who has millions of followers on Twitch and other social media platforms  summoned his fans to the area  where he said he would give away video game consoles. The gathering lacked a city permit  and the police learned of it from a social media post only hours before the crowd began swelling  officials said at the time. Hordes of young people were soon packing Union Square Park and spilling onto the surrounding streets and sidewalks and blocking cars and pedestrians. The Union Square Greenmarket shut down early  and subway trains began bypassing the Union Square station. Within an hour  the Police Department had initiated a Level 4 mobilization  its highest-level response. Some in the crowd were peaceful  but others were not. One cluster of people stormed a construction site. Building materials  rocks  bottles  basketballs  a computer and fireworks sailed through the crowd. “I believe he saw that day how much influence he really has ” Jeffrey Maddrey  the Police Department’s chief of department  said of Mr. Cenat afterward.","New York","Not related to Blockchain"

Trump’s trial said he would consider jailing the former president should he continue to violate court orders  Mayor Eric Adams said the city’s lockups stand ready. “Our amazing commissioner  she is prepared for whatever comes on Rikers Island ” said the mayor at an unrelated news conference  apparently referring to Lynelle Maginley-Liddie  the commissioner of the Department of Correction. “I’m pretty sure she would be prepared to manage and deal with the situation.” Justice Juan M. Merchan  the judge presiding over Mr. Trump’s criminal trial in Lower Manhattan  on Monday warned the former president that should he continue to defy a gag order  he might end up on Rikers  because fines “are not serving as a deterrent.” “Going forward  this court will have to consider jail ” Justice Merchan said. The judge has prohibited the former president from making attacks on witnesses  jurors and court staff  an order Mr. Trump has repeatedly violated. The prospect of Mr. Trump ending up on Rikers Island  New York City’s main jail and a notoriously violent  dilapidated facility  has already been the topic of discussion among federal  state and local officials.

If Mr. Trump does end up on Rikers Island  he would be in prominent company. His longtime financial lieutenant  Allen H. Weisselberg  is serving a five-month sentence on Rikers for perjury.

Trump met Stormy Daniels  their flirtation seemed fleeting: He was a 60-year-old married mogul at the peak of reality television fame  and she was 27  a Louisiana native raised in poverty and headed to porn-film stardom. But that chance encounter in Lake Tahoe  Nev.  some two decades ago is now at the center of the first criminal trial of an American president  an unprecedented case that could shape the 2024 presidential race.

Trump and the ensuing hush-money cover-up that has become the bedrock of the prosecution’s case. Ms. Daniels spoke quickly and at length about her first meeting with Mr. Trump at a celebrity golf tournament near Lake Tahoe in Nevada. After the lunch break  Mr. Trump’s lawyer Todd Blanche moved for a mistrial  arguing that the prosecution’s questions had been designed to embarrass Mr. Trump and prejudice the jury. The judge  Juan M. Merchan  agreed that some of Ms. Daniels’s testimony might have “been better left unsaid ” but he denied a mistrial. The former president is accused of falsifying business records to cover up a $130 000 payment to Ms. Daniels just before the 2016 election. Mr. Trump  77  has denied the charges and says he did not have sex with Ms. Daniels. If convicted  he could face prison time or probation. Here are six takeaways from Mr. Trump’s 13th day on trial. Prosecutors took a risk with their witness. Jurors heard a vivid account of the Lake Tahoe encounter and met the woman who received the hush-money deal. This could present a risk for prosecutors  depending on whether the jury viewed Ms. Daniels’s story as prurient or powerful.

That inquiry reflects the evolving calculations of Mr. Trump’s vice-presidential search — and how his scramble to keep up with President Biden’s colossal fund-raising totals may be weighing on his mind as he considers his options. Mr. Trump’s selection process  which is still in its early stages  has largely revolved around conventional questions like who could step in as president if needed  political calculations including contenders’ position on abortion rights  and more Trumpian curiosities like whether a politician physically resembles his idea of a vice president. But Mr. Trump has asked several people about the fund-raising prowess of possible running mates  according to three people with direct knowledge of the conversations  signaling a fresh angle in his search for a running mate. The initial feedback has pointed him toward a handful of members of Congress with strong donor connections and at least one deep-pocketed governor.

Nikki Haley of South Carolina — was only recently a bitter presidential rival  and her name can spark outrage from Mr. Trump. “Trump is going to want a team player  and this is going to be about adding value to the ticket ” said former Speaker Kevin McCarthy  who remains close with Mr. Trump and set records for Republican fund-raising. “It’s also going to be about someone who understands the job — who understands the Senate and the House — because he’s not going to want to waste one minute in office.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

But the government has not given up the fight with the tech industry. Open Whisper Systems  a maker of a widely used encryption app called Signal  received a subpoena in the first half of the year for subscriber information and other details associated with two phone numbers that came up in a federal grand jury investigation in Virginia. The subpoena arrived with a court order that said Open Whisper Systems was not allowed to tell anyone about the information request for one year. Technology companies contend that court-imposed gag orders are being used too often by law enforcement and that they violate the Bill of Rights. The companies also complain that law enforcement officials are casting a wide net over online communications — often too wide — in their investigations. Justice Department officials  for their part  argue that these gag orders are necessary to protect developing cases and to avoid tipping off potential targets. The officials say that they are simply following leads where they take them. Through a spokesman  the Justice Department declined to comment on the case. The information request made of Open Whisper Systems is particularly sensitive  since its encryption app is used around the world  and it is often recommended to journalists and human rights activists.

Hours earlier  Israeli tanks and troops entered the southern Gaza city of Rafah and seized control of the border crossing with Egypt  halting the flow of aid into the enclave. U.N. officials warned that the humanitarian crisis in the besieged territory would worsen. Here’s the latest. Benjamin Netanyahu  the Israeli prime minister who is under pressure from the U.S. and other allies to agree to a truce  said that while he had sent negotiators back to the talks  “in tandem  we continue waging the war on Hamas.” Analysts said that Israel’s incursion into Rafah could either ratchet up the pressure on Hamas to make a deal or sabotage the talks. But the move did not appear to be the full ground invasion of Rafah that Israel had long been threatening and that its allies had been working to avert  and the Israeli military called the move “a very precise” counterterrorism operation. Devastating consequences: The head of a hospital in Rafah said that 27 bodies and 150 wounded people had been brought to his facility since the start of the incursion. The Israeli military said it had killed about 20 people in Rafah  describing the dead as Hamas militants. Analysis: Netanyahu  under pressure from all sides  is trying to reassure his many domestic  military and diplomatic critics. Here’s a look at what he is confronting. In other news from the war: International officials condemned the incursion. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry called Israel’s seizure of the Rafah border crossing a “dangerous escalation ” while Josep Borrell Fontelles  the top E.U. diplomat  said that he feared it would cause “a lot of casualties.” President Biden paused an arms shipment to Israel last week to prevent the U.S.-made weapons from being used in an assault on Rafah  administration officials said last night.

In Melbourne, some of their descendants are leading the way to preserve the Yiddish language.","“Mir kumen on  mir kumen on! Un fest un zikher undzer trot!” Late on a recent Friday night  dozens of voices joined in this Yiddish anthem — “We are coming  we are coming! And our step is firm and true!” — and soared from a conference center among gum trees and kookaburras outside Melbourne  Australia. Today  Yiddish is most commonly used in ultra-Orthodox communities in places like Brooklyn or Jerusalem. But in Melbourne  snatches of it can be heard on certain streets  around multigenerational dinner tables  on stages and in classrooms. And one weekend a year  Australian speakers of Yiddish come together at Sof-Vokh Oystralye  or Weekend Australia  for 48 hours of total immersion in the language of a thousand years of Jewish life and culture that  before the Holocaust  was spoken by 13 million people  mostly in Eastern Europe. For some of the singers at this year’s retreat  in late May  Yiddish is the hard-fought language of everyday life. For others  it evokes a long-ago childhood in an immigrant neighborhood in Melbourne. For many of the tiniest participants  including some who had already been dispatched to bed  it is the language of the classroom  sitting easily alongside Hebrew and English at the world’s only secular primary school where it is a compulsory daily subject. Image Zelda bakery in Melbourne sells kosher breads and pastries.Credit...Christina Simons for The New York Times At Sof-Vokh  attendees in beanies and scarves emblazoned with the insignia of Australian football teams played Dungeons and Dragons  basketball and chess; smeared creamy cheese into blintzes in a stainless steel-wrapped catering kitchen; and played games in which they impersonated animals and translated gibberish into poetry — all in Yiddish.

Conocido por los pueblos aborígenes del desierto occidental de Australia como kakarratul  no tiene ojos y su pelaje es desgreñado y dorado. Con solo 10 centímetros de nariz a cola  el animal cabe en la palma de la mano. Y  a diferencia de los topos de Norteamérica  es un marsupial. Pero probablemente no verías ninguno: aunque los animales son abundantes  los avistamientos siguen siendo muy raros porque los topos marsupiales del norte viven en túneles bajo las dunas de arena  y navegan con un movimiento similar al de la natación utilizando unas patas delanteras parecidas a aletas. “Es el animal más difícil de encontrar”  afirmó Denzel Hunter  guarda forestal indígena que trabaja en la vigilancia y conservación de la fauna salvaje en las tierras del pueblo Nyangumarta. “Cada vez que salimos a buscar topos marsupiales del norte  encontramos pruebas de que están ahí. Pero yo nunca he visto ninguno”. A principios de este mes  los guardabosques Kanyirninpa Jukurrpa Martu encontraron un kakarratul en el Gran Desierto Arenoso  a casi 1609 kilómetros al noreste de Perth. Las fotografías de la criatura  que solo había sido vista un puñado de veces en la última década  amplían el conocimiento científico de la especie y de las regiones desérticas  que constituyen casi un tercio de la superficie de Australia. El hallazgo también pone en relieve el valor de los 60 grupos de guardas forestales del desierto que supervisan gran parte del sistema nacional de zonas protegidas de Australia.

Known to the First Nations peoples in the Western Desert of Australia as the kakarratul  it is eyeless and has shaggy golden fur. Just four inches from nose to tail  the animal would fit in the palm of your hand. And unlike the mole species of North America  it is a marsupial. But you probably wouldn’t see one: While the animals are plentiful  sightings remain extremely rare because northern marsupial moles live in tunnels beneath sand dunes  navigating them with a swimming-like motion using flipper-like front feet. “This is the hardest of all the animals to find ” said Denzel Hunter  an Indigenous ranger who works to survey and conserve wildlife in the lands of the Nyangumarta people. “Every time we go out looking for northern marsupial moles  we find evidence that they’re there. But I’ve never seen one.” Earlier this month  Kanyirninpa Jukurrpa Martu rangers found a kakarratul in the Great Sandy Desert  nearly 1 000 miles northeast of Perth. Their photographs of the creature  which has been spotted only a handful of times in the past decade  expand scientific knowledge of the species as well as of the wider desert regions that make up close to one-third of Australia’s land mass. The find also highlights the value of the 60 desert ranger groups that oversee much of Australia’s national system of protected areas. “It’s once you start digging into the detail of that country with the people who know it best that you really start to get an appreciation of the place ” said Gareth Catt  who as program manager of the Indigenous Desert Alliance has worked extensively with ranger programs. “It’s the Indigenous rangers that have that enduring connection and are best placed to understand and look after that country.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Wind farms in Minnesota and North Dakota have been abruptly canceled. And programs to encourage Massachusetts and Maine residents to adopt solar power are faltering. The energy transition poised for takeoff in the United States amid record investment in wind  solar and other low-carbon technologies is facing a serious obstacle: The volume of projects has overwhelmed the nation’s antiquated systems to connect new sources of electricity to homes and businesses. So many projects are trying to squeeze through the approval process that delays can drag on for years  leaving some developers to throw up their hands and walk away. More than 8 100 energy projects — the vast majority of them wind  solar and batteries — were waiting for permission to connect to electric grids at the end of 2021  up from 5 600 the year before  jamming the system known as interconnection. That’s the process by which electricity generated by wind turbines or solar arrays is added to the grid — the network of power lines and transformers that moves electricity from the spot where it is created to cities and factories. There is no single grid; the United States has dozens of electric networks  each overseen by a different authority. PJM Interconnection  which operates the nation’s largest regional grid  stretching from Illinois to New Jersey  has been so inundated by connection requests that last year it announced a freeze on new applications until 2026  so that it can work through a backlog of thousands of proposals  mostly for renewable energy.

Chargers Are Coming - The New York Times","2024-05-07T19:01:27.000Z","By Manuela Andreoni","Experts say that a new wave of electric vehicle charging stations are coming soon, even after Tesla gutted its charger team.","Last week  Tesla laid off most of its electric car charging team  raising doubts about the feasibility of the Biden administration’s ambitious E.V. expansion plans. Though Tesla accounts for more than half of the fast E.V. chargers currently installed in the United States  and though it has continued to build them faster and cheaper than anyone else  the E.V. charging market may no longer need Tesla to lead it. In fact  experts I spoke to believe the E.V. charging industry is set to expand quickly over the next few years. Let me explain why. At first  Tesla’s move seemed like a blow to a sector that may seem like it’s struggling to grow despite the $7.5 billion investment from the bipartisan infrastructure law passed by President Biden in 2021. The administration’s goal is to build a network of a half million fast and slow chargers in the country by 2030  more than double what the U.S. has today. But roughly two and a half years after the bill’s passage only eight federally funded charging stations have opened in six states  according to government data. Elon Musk  Tesla’s C.E.O.  hasn’t explained why he decided to cut back on charger construction  but some analysts interviewed by my colleagues Jack Ewing and Ivan Penn said he had probably concluded that it would become harder to make money from charging as more companies entered the market. As Ewing and Penn wrote  last year all major automakers selling cars in North America agreed to use the charging plug developed by Tesla  which has a reputation for being reliable and easy-to-use.

The layoffs of about 500 Tesla employees  which many of them posted about on social media on Tuesday  raised questions about deals that Mr. Musk  Tesla’s chief executive  struck with the leaders of General Motors  Ford Motor and other automakers last year allowing cars made by other companies to use Tesla Supercharger stations. Tesla’s agreements with other makers of electric cars assured buyers that they would be able to find fast chargers on road trips  addressing one of the main reasons that many people are hesitant to buy such cars. It was also seen as a coup for Mr. Musk  validating Tesla’s technology and giving the company outsize influence over the auto industry. Almost all major manufacturers announced plans to switch the hardware and software in their cars to make them compatible with Tesla’s chargers. Ford has been mailing adapters to owners of its older electric vehicles so they can connect to Tesla’s chargers. Mr. Musk said on X  the social media site he owns  that Tesla would slow down construction of new charging stations and increase its “focus on 100% uptime and expansion of existing locations.” On Monday  in an email to employees that was reviewed by The New York Times  Mr. Musk said he would dissolve the “entire group of approximately 500 people” that had worked on building new Supercharger stations. In that message  he said the company would finish stations under construction and build some new ones “where critical.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Toymakers Want to Hear From You. - The New York Times","2024-05-04T09:00:14.000Z","By Isaac Aronow","Companies like Lego and Mattel have divisions that seek out design concepts directly from collectors and other highly dedicated fan bases.","Near the end of 2022  Lucas Bolt  an environmental artist and Lego enthusiast in Amsterdam  was working on a design for a Lego set the company had crowdsourced to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Dungeons & Dragons  the tabletop role-playing game. “I spent two very intense weeks working on it  every night  every weekend  all the time that I had ” he said. Mr. Bolt was hoping to create the design for Lego Ideas  a program the toymaker started in 2008 to solicit ideas online directly from fans. Typically  designers post their concept on the platform  and if a design gets 10 000 votes  the company considers it for production. This case was different  though: It was the first time the company had given fans a concept to work with. Mr. Bolt had been designing his own sets for a few years  primarily for his followers on Instagram  but this was the first time something he had produced had gained real traction. A panel of judges selected his set and four others for a shortlist  and in a vote fans chose his set as their favorite. Lego Ideas is part of a growing strategy among companies that are creating divisions devoted to going directly to consumers for ideas. Lego takes a more personal approach  allowing fans to submit designs  while other companies poll consumers about what they would like to see or speak to inventors about their latest projects. These initiatives are finding particular success within niche groups of collectors and other highly dedicated fans. Toy companies that have direct-to-consumer models do not have the same audience reach that distributors like Amazon have  but a unit devoted to direct sales still provides advantages for the overall business  said Jaime M. Katz  an analyst who covers the toy industry for Morningstar  a financial services company. The primary reason companies like direct sales is the speed at which they are able to get access to purchasing data from consumers. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

The New Yorker posted a roughly nine-minute video titled “Professional Scrabble Players Replay Their Greatest Moves ” and I  not even knowing that one could be a “professional Scrabble player ” clicked immediately. In that video  some of the game’s greatest players showed off moves that were impressive and exciting  even without their full contexts. I had a little bit of experience with the game  but after watching the video I was totally hooked  and wanted to start playing the game at a high level. The idea of being someone who could decipher an obscure anagram from a handful of randomly selected letters appealed to me. The competitive element further boosted my interest. Armed with The New Yorker video and a lot of hubris  I took to an online crossword game server and was beaten so badly I wasn’t sure I wanted to ever play again. I lost by over 150 points  an absolutely brutal defeat. “But ” I thought  “you have to be bad at something before you get good at it ” so I queued up for another game  and was promptly routed by a different player  this time by an even greater margin. I like words a lot. I was never a “read the dictionary for fun” person  but I do love a good instruction manual. A big part of my job is making sure words are being used properly  by the book  and part of that means knowing the difference between a podium and a lectern (a podium is a flat  raised platform; a lectern is a stand for holding notes). The most striking thing I learned as I kept playing (and losing) online  though  was the value of two-letter words. Scrabble is a crossword game  and I had been thinking about it in the sense of long  marquee answers. In reality  being able to play small and make space for those big answers is just as valuable  if not more valuable  than being able to deftly figure out anagrams. Preventing your opponent from making a high-scoring play is valuable if you’re ahead  especially if extending your lead means opening up scoring opportunities for them. For top-level competitive Scrabble players  where you place a word on the board matters a lot more than the word itself. Many top players don’t know the meanings of many common Scrabble words (the game’s rules don’t require them to)  and the game becomes far more about strategy than anything else.

Minced oaths are euphemistically rendered expressions of profanity or obscenity that gained popularity among playwrights of the Elizabethan era. Bowdlerization began a few hundred years later  when a well-meaning couple sought to make Shakespeare more family-friendly. And today  the teens use algospeak to avoid censors on TikTok  often using emojis in place of words. While I cannot confirm that Michael Schlossberg constructed today’s crossword with any of those strategies in mind  I can tell you that solving his puzzle will give you a particularly creative way to express your delight about what lies inside the grid. Today’s Theme I can honestly say that I let out a “Little laugh” (53D) when I entered the revealer of Mr. Schlossberg’s puzzle (though mine sounded a little more like a “hehe” than a TEHEE). “What you might cry upon recognizing this puzzle’s ingredient list?” (62A) requires first solving the entries with gray-shaded squares: 17A  20A  32A  42A and 54A.

But I can assure you that its creator  Justin Werfel  and Ms. Handa didn’t arrange for their grids to appear on consecutive days. As Christina Iverson  a puzzle editor for The New York Times  has explained in the Easy Mode newsletter — which I recommend to any beginners looking to improve their solving skills — eerie coincidences in the Times Crossword are just that: coincidences. Mr. Werfel’s debut crossword for The Times  however  is no matter of chance: It takes creativity  diligence and attention to detail for a constructor’s puzzle to make its way to publication  and I found this one to be a winning combination of all three. I look forward to seeing more from him in the future. Today’s Theme What do a door-to-door salesman  a cathedral worker and an acclaimed experimental neurologist have in common? First  let’s identify the characters in question: Our salesman is WILLY LOMAN (16A)  from a classic Arthur Miller play. QUASIMODO (35A) is the “Victor Hugo character who works at Notre Dame.” And IVAN PAVLOV (47A) was the Nobel Prize-winning scientist “who conditioned dogs to salivate.” Now  let’s consider the revealer  which asks for an expression that means “Sounds familiar” (57A). The answer is RINGS A BELL. And this is the “action associated with” the three men above: Loman rang doorbells  Quasimodo tolled the church bell and Pavlov used a bell to make dogs think it was dinnertime. Ding  ding  ding!

Jr.? - The New York Times","2024-05-04T09:05:13.000Z","By Nate Cohn","Categorizing previous third-party bids helps us understand where he fits in and where he might wind up.","Image Ross Perot was in the middle of things in a 1992 debate with George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Credit...Marcy Nighswander/Associated Press With six months to go until the election  it’s still too early to judge whether Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  the Democrat-turned-independent candidate for president  will prove to be more than a mere spoiler. He starts out with roughly 10 percent of the vote and one of the most famous names in American politics. It’s enough to at least contemplate whether he’ll be the kind of third-party candidate who makes a lasting mark. Even without having won the presidency  third-party candidates have often played an important and even healthy role in American politics. They can elevate new issues  represent marginal constituencies and sometimes even win plenty of votes: Six third-party candidates have either won states or reached double digits in the national vote since the rise of the two-party system. They can be a lot more than mere spoilers. Image The most distinguishing views of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are not on the typical major issues but on vaccines. Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York Times The polling shows many of the conditions for a successful third-party candidacy could be in place. Voters dislike both candidates. They’ve been dissatisfied with the state of the country for 20 years  but for the most part the campaign season hasn’t been focused on solutions to customary longstanding problems. It’s enough to wonder whether this might be the first time since 1992 that a third-party-candidate gains a meaningful foothold. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Credit...Jane Rosenberg/Reuters Donald J. Trump appears to be a stronger candidate than he was four years ago  polling suggests  and not just because a notable number of voters look back on his presidency as a time of relative peace and prosperity. It’s also because his political liabilities  like his penchant to offend and his legal woes  don’t dominate the news the way they once did. In the last New York Times/Siena College poll  only 38 percent of voters said they’d been offended by Mr. Trump “recently ” even as more than 70 percent said they had been offended by him at some point. We didn’t ask a question like this back in 2016 or 2020 for comparison (unfortunately)  but my subjective thumb-in-the-wind gauge says that  if we had  more voters would have said yes to the “recently offended” question. Mr. Trump’s most outrageous comments just don’t dominate the news cycle the way they did four to eight years ago. Similarly  many voters seem to be tuning out his myriad legal challenges. A majority of voters said they thought he had committed federal crimes  but only 27 percent of registered voters in the last Times/Siena poll said they were paying “a lot of attention” to the news about the legal cases against him. That’s much lower than the 39 percent back in October 2019 who said they were paying a lot of attention to the Trump-Ukraine controversy (the “perfect” phone call). It seems plausible that the lack of attention paid to Mr. Trump contributed to his early strength in the polling. Voters generally still don’t like him — in fact  his favorability rating is unchanged from our 2020 polling. But his liabilities just aren’t in the forefront of people’s minds  making it easier for the “double haters” — those who tell pollsters they dislike both candidates — to back him over President Biden.

Trump’s presidency have become more positive since he left office  bolstering his case for election and posing a risk to President Biden’s strategy of casting his opponent as unfit for the presidency  according to a new poll by The New York Times and Siena College. While the memories of Mr. Trump’s tumultuous and chaotic administration have not significantly faded  many voters now have a rosier picture of his handling of the economy  immigration and maintaining law and order. Ahead of the 2020 election  only 39 percent of voters said that the country was better off after Mr. Trump took office. Now  looking back  nearly half say that he improved things during his time as president. The poll’s findings underscore the way in which a segment of voters have changed their minds about the Trump era  recalling those years as a time of economic prosperity and strong national security. The shift in views about his administration comes even as Mr. Trump faces dozens of felony counts and will appear in a New York courtroom on Monday for jury selection in one of his four criminal trials.

Based on CBS News/New York Times polls of registered voters conducted in the fall of 2016 and New York Times/Siena College polls conducted in the fall of 2020 and in April 2024. Many voters still remember Mr. Trump as a divisive and polarizing figure  giving him low ratings on race relations and unifying the country. Yet  a larger share of voters see Mr. Trump’s term as better for the country than the current administration  with 42 percent rating the Trump presidency as mostly good for the country compared with 25 percent who say the same about Mr. Biden’s. Nearly half say the Biden years have been mostly bad for the country. Many of Mr. Trump’s key constituencies  such as white voters without a college degree  are particularly likely to have a fond view of his time in office. But a broad swath of the country — including Hispanic voters  voters over 30 and most lower- and middle-income voters — now see Mr. Trump’s years in office as more good than bad.

Symptoms included high fever  trouble breathing and lung lesions  but Chinese health officials said there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Two days later  Chinese scientists identified the source of the new disease: a previously unidentified coronavirus. Within weeks  the pathogen was sickening scores of people in Wuhan  and China took the drastic step of locking down the city  effectively sealing off its 11 million inhabitants from the world. Then  time seemed to accelerate. Seismic events began to take place  one after the next: Professional sports leagues around the world suspended seasons. Stocks plunged. Donald Trump cut off travel from Europe. The World Health Organization declared the virus a pandemic. Soon  entire countries began shutting down. Popular tourist sites and metropolises across the world became ghost towns. By early April  authorities had told four billion people — roughly half of humanity — to stay home. “If you look at the very beginning  we found ourselves in — at least in our memory — the unprecedented situation of the evolution of what would turn out to be one of the most devastating pandemics in more than a century ” Dr. Anthony Fauci  who helped lead the U.S. government’s response to the pandemic  told me this week. “That  at first  was complicated by the opaqueness of the Chinese authorities and letting the rest of the world know what was actually going on.” In those initial days  there was so much we didn’t know — and so much speculation and misinformation — that The New York Times started a newsletter on March 2  2020  to serve as an informed guide to the global outbreak.

After four days  he went to a hospital  and a doctor told him he had a form of viral pneumonia  without offering specifics. Mr. Li  42  was hospitalized  then transferred to another facility and quarantined with other patients who had similarly unexplained symptoms. Mr. Li is one of 59 people in the central city of Wuhan who have been sickened by a pneumonia-like illness  the cause of which is unclear. The cases have alarmed Chinese officials  who are racing to unravel the mystery behind them in a region where the memory of an outbreak of the dangerous respiratory disease known as SARS remains fresh. SARS originated in China and killed more than 800 people worldwide in 2002 and 2003. At the time  the Chinese government tried to cover up the problem  which is exacerbating fear now about this new illness. Symptoms of the new illness include high fever  difficulty breathing and lung lesions  the Wuhan health commission has said. No deaths have been reported but seven people are critically ill.

Hours later  the political leader of Hamas  Ismail Haniyeh  said that the group had accepted a cease-fire proposal from Qatar and Egypt. The full details of the proposal were unclear  but the conflict remains unresolved. Comments by Hamas and Israeli officials made it clear that Haniyeh was not referring to the plan that Israel had recently put forward. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the proposal did not meet Israel’s demands. Israel’s war cabinet had also decided unanimously to “continue with its action in Rafah in order to exert military pressure on Hamas ” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. Thousands of people were leaving Rafah yesterday  according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society  which said that there had been “escalating Israeli airstrikes” in areas east of the city. A sense of panic coursed through the city  as prices for food and fuel skyrocketed. Context: Israel seems set to invade Rafah  despite pressure from the country’s closest allies  including the U.S.  arguing that doing so would take a heavy toll on civilians. An Israeli military spokesman would not say when troops might enter the city  but described the evacuation as part of Israel’s plans to dismantle Hamas and to free hostages taken on Oct. 7.

He will also visit Serbia and Hungary. The three countries  to varying degrees  are embracing China’s push for a new global order. Xi seems intent on seizing opportunities to loosen the continent’s bonds with the U.S. and forge a world freed of its dominance. The visit is likely to be seen as a none-too-subtle effort by Xi to divide Western allies. Soon after arriving in Paris  he praised France  whose president  Emmanuel Macron  has often made the Gaullist point that Europe “must never be a vassal of the United States.” The chemistry between Xi and Macron — who visited China just over a year ago  and echoed the Chinese lexicon of a “multipolar” world  freed of “blocs” — appears to lie in a shared view that the postwar order must be replaced. Xi wants to court leaders who are frustrated by U.S. dominance  see China as a counterweight and are eager to bolster economic ties. Analysis: “Macron is trying to bring a third way in the current global chaos ” said one French expert on relations with China. What’s next: Tomorrow  Xi heads to Serbia.

The Chinese leader has chosen three countries to visit — France  Serbia and Hungary — that all  to a greater or lesser degree  look askance at America’s postwar ordering of the world  see China as a necessary counterweight and are eager to bolster economic ties. At a time of tensions with much of Europe — over China’s “no limits” embrace of Russia despite the war in Ukraine  its surveillance state and its apparent espionage activities that led to the recent arrest in Germany of four people — Mr. Xi  who arrived in France on Sunday  wants to demonstrate China’s growing influence on the continent and pursue a pragmatic rapprochement. For Europe  the visit will test its delicate balancing act between China and the United States and will no doubt be seen in Washington as a none-too-subtle effort by Mr. Xi to divide Western allies. Chinese-French relations “have established a model for the international community of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation between countries with different social systems ” Mr. Xi said in a statement issued soon after he arrived in Paris.

If only the weather had cooperated.","The French president  Emmanuel Macron  who believes that a personal touch is the key to diplomacy  lured President Xi Jinping of China to a 7 000-foot pass in the Pyrenees on Tuesday  expecting to show off the sweeping views that had stamped his childhood  but instead finding dense fog and wild snow flurries. It was a long  slippery road up the mountain  under torrential rain  but that didn’t stop crowds of Chinese admirers with red flags and pennants from gathering in almost every village along the way  miraculously transposed to a remote area of southwestern France and seemingly uniform in their enthusiasm. Undeterred  but running two hours late  Mr. Macron greeted Mr. Xi under an umbrella at one of his favorite restaurants  L’Étape du Berger  or the Shepherd’s Stop  where dancers in colorful local dress twirled and jigged to the sounds of a flute  an accordion and a tom-tom. Mr. Xi was impassive  but his wife  Peng Liyuan  smiled broadly and applauded. Using the familiar “tu” form to address Mr. Xi  70  rather than the formal “vous” that would have been more customary between heads of state  Mr. Macron  46  offered the Chinese leader a yellow jersey signed by last year’s Tour de France winner  Jonas Vingegaard  a Danish cyclist. “I know how much you love sport ” Mr. Macron said. Mr. Xi is known for his interest in soccer. The Col du Tourmalet  where the leaders met  has mythical status in the Tour de France; its steep and winding ascent is a severe test. It is also a place dear to Mr. Macron  who regularly came here from his home in northern France to stay at the nearby house of his maternal grandmother  Germaine Nogues  the member of his family about whom he speaks most effusively.

Mr. Macron and Ursula von der Leyen  the European Commission’s president  who attended a morning session of talks  pressured Mr. Xi to use his influence on Moscow to bring the war to an end.

The front line is a place of ghastly violence where hundreds of thousands of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers have been killed or wounded  according to conservative Western estimates. The list of Ukrainian cities and towns largely razed to the ground by Russian bombs and artillery grows with each passing month. Russian forces have moved forward in small increments  suffering a staggering number of casualties to take cities like Avdiivka  which Moscow captured in February. Away from the front  millions of Ukrainians have spent hours in bomb shelters as Russia continues to rain down missiles and drones on military units and civilians across the nation. Ukraine’s energy grid is severely damaged — working but sporadic. Thousands of schools  hospitals and cultural institutions have been damaged or destroyed. Millions have lost their homes.

They said the plot also targeted top Ukrainian intelligence officials.","Ukraine’s security services said on Tuesday that they had foiled a Russian plot to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky and other top military and political figures. Two Ukrainian colonels accused of participating in the plot have been arrested on suspicion of treason. The Ukrainian domestic intelligence agency  the S.B.U.  said in a statement that the plot had involved a network of agents — including the two colonels — that was run by Russia’s Federal Security Service  or F.S.B.  the main successor to the K.G.B. According to the S.B.U.  the agents working at Russia’s direction were tasked with identifying people close to Mr. Zelensky’s security detail who could take him hostage and later kill him. The agency’s statement said the other top Ukrainian officials targeted in the plot included Vasyl Malyuk  the head of the S.B.U.  and Gen. Kyrylo Budanov  the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency. The Ukrainian claims could not be independently verified. It is not the first time that Ukraine has reported a potential assassination attempt aimed at its top leaders. Mr. Zelensky said in an interview with an Italian television channel earlier this year that his security services had told him of more than 10 such efforts. Ukraine’s security services offered few details about previous assassination plots. But this time  the agency went to some length in its statement to describe how the Ukrainian officials were to be killed. The services said the two colonels accused in the plot belonged to the State Security Administration  which protects top officials. They had been recruited before the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022  according to the statement  which identified three F.S.B. members — Maxim Mishustin  Dmytro Perlin and Oleksiy Kornev — as running the operation from Moscow.

On Thursday  he is to preside over the Victory Day parade in Red Square  an annual demonstration of military might that in the last two years sought to symbolically link Russia’s war in Ukraine with the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. The Kremlin is also expected to nominate a prime minister and five key ministers  including foreign and defense  though the officials in those six posts may simply be renominated.

Putin’s promotion of traditional family roles with the need for new recruits for the war in Ukraine. The military’s stepped-up appeal to women includes efforts to recruit female inmates in prisons  replicating on a much smaller scale a strategy that has swelled its ranks with male convicts. Recruiters in military uniforms toured Russian jails for women in the fall of 2023  offering inmates a pardon and $2 000 a month — 10 times the national minimum wage — in return for serving in frontline roles for a year  according to six current and former inmates of three prisons in different regions of Russia. Dozens of inmates just from those prisons have signed military contracts or applied to enlist  the women said  a sampling that — along with local media reports about recruitment in other regions — suggests a broader effort to enlist female convicts. It’s not just convicts. Women now feature in Russian military recruitment advertisements across the country. A pro-Kremlin paramilitary unit fighting in Ukraine also recruits women. “Combat experience and military specialties are not required ” read an advertisement aimed at women that was posted in March in Russia’s Tatarstan region.

The majority were convicted drug sellers or murderers  seeking redemption  money or a path to freedom. They were told they could be killed or maimed. Many of them were. The New York Times obtained exclusive documents providing the fullest picture yet of Russia’s secretive prison recruiting effort  which Moscow is using to replenish the army in its war against Ukraine. Supported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENT A Prison at War: The Convicts Sustaining Putin’s Invasion Aleksandr Mokin had lost the will to live. Convicted of selling drugs and ostracized by his family  he endured abuse from guards and frequent spells in solitary confinement at a high-security Russian prison. He told a friend he felt alone and racked with guilt. Then  in the summer of 2022  Mr. Mokin and other inmates in Penal Colony No. 6 in the Chelyabinsk region started hearing rumors. One of Russia’s most powerful men was reportedly touring jails and offering pardons for prisoners who survived six months of fighting in Ukraine. And by October of last year  there he was  Yevgeny V. Prigozhin  standing before them in his military fatigues  himself an ex-con who now ran a private military company  Wagner. He offered freedom and money  even as he warned that the price for many would be death. Mr. Mokin and 196 other inmates enlisted the same day. “I really wish to be there  knowing that this is likely to be a journey without return ” Mr. Mokin  then 35 and serving an 11-year sentence  told a friend in a text message that was viewed by The New York Times. Two months later  Mr. Mokin was dead. A social media post showing his grave is the only known public tribute to his short life. As the war in Ukraine grinds to a stalemate  Mr. Mokin’s ultimate legacy may be his small role in a much bigger  globally significant enterprise: He was one of tens of thousands of convicts powering the Kremlin’s war machine. Even now  with Mr. Prigozhin dead and Wagner disbanded  Russian inmates are still enlisting in what has become the largest military prison recruitment program since World War II. “He said ‘I don’t care where I die  in IK6 or in Ukraine.’” —Valentina  a former spouse of Andrei Vorobei “He was a calm  good person. He ended up in prison out of stupidity  and decided to shorten his sentence.” —Olia  a former colleague of Sergei Monastirshin “He had said that he was sentenced unjustly.

One asked for bags of ground coffee because he could not stand the energy drinks supplied by the army. Another simply requested beans: He had taken his own grinder to the front. “I was really shocked ” Mr. Vradii said in a recent interview at his roastery  a 40-foot-high brick building buzzing with the sound of grinding coffee and filled with the smell of freshly ground beans. “Despite the war  people were still thinking about coffee. They could leave their homes  their habits. But they could not live without coffee.” The soldiers’ requests are just one facet of a little-known cornerstone of the Ukrainian lifestyle today: its vibrant coffee culture. Over the past decade  coffee shops have proliferated across Ukraine  in cities large and small. That is particularly true in Kyiv  the capital  where small coffee kiosks staffed by trained baristas serving tasty mochas for less than $2 have become a fixture of the streetscape.

The State Department said in a statement on Wednesday that Russia had used chloropicrin  a “choking agent” widely used during World War I  as well as tear gas  against Ukrainian troops. The use of these gases in warfare is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention  an arms control treaty ratified by more than 150 countries  including Russia. “The use of such chemicals is not an isolated incident and is probably driven by Russian forces’ desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield ” the State Department said. Russia has been slowly but steadily pushing through Ukrainian defenses in the east this year  capturing several towns and villages. The State Department also said that the United States would impose sanctions on three state entities linked to Russia’s chemical and biological weapons programs and four companies that supported them. Anatoly Antonov  Russia’s ambassador to the United States  called the accusations that Russian forces had used chemical weapons “odious and unsubstantiated” in a post on the Telegram messaging app. The Ukrainian authorities have reported about 1 400 cases of suspected chemical weapons use on the battlefield by Russia since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022  and say that the rate has accelerated as Moscow has pressed ahead with attacks along the front line.

Then came Trump and everything after.","Listen to This Article FORT SMITH  Ark. — In the fall of 2020  Kevin Thompson delivered a sermon about the gentleness of God. At one point  he drew a quick contrast between a loving  accessible God and remote  inaccessible celebrities. Speaking without notes  his Bible in his hand  he reached for a few easy examples: Oprah  Jay-Z  Tom Hanks. Mr. Thompson could not tell how his sermon was received. The church he led had only recently returned to meeting in person. Attendance was sparse  and it was hard to appreciate if his jokes were landing  or if his congregation — with family groups spaced three seats apart  and others watching online — remained engaged. So he was caught off guard when two church members expressed alarm about the passing reference to Mr. Hanks. A young woman texted him  concerned; another member suggested the reference to Mr. Hanks proved Mr. Thompson did not care about the issue of sex trafficking. Mr. Thompson soon realized that their worries sprung from the sprawling QAnon conspiracy theory  which claims that the movie star is part of a ring of Hollywood pedophiles. For decades  Mr. Thompson  44  had been confident that he knew the people of Fort Smith  a small city tucked under a bend in the Arkansas River along the Oklahoma border. He was born at the oldest hospital in town  attended public schools there and grew up in a Baptist church that encouraged him to start preaching as a teenager. He assumed he would live in Fort Smith for the rest of his life. But now  he was not so sure. “Jesus talks about how he is the truth  how central truth is ” Mr. Thompson said in an interview. “The moment you lose the concept of truth you’ve lost everything.” A political moment in which the Supreme Court appears on the brink of overturning Roe v. Wade looks like a triumphant era for conservative evangelicals. But there are deepening cracks beneath that ascendance. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Luego llegó Trump y todo lo demás.","FORT SMITH  Arkansas — En el otoño de 2020  el pastor Kevin Thompson dio un sermón sobre la dulzura de Dios. En algún momento  hizo una breve comparación entre un Dios amoroso y al alcance y las celebridades distantes e inalcanzables. Sin recurrir a apuntes y con la Biblia en la mano  dio algunos ejemplos simples: Oprah  Jay-Z  Tom Hanks. Puesto que la iglesia apenas abría de nuevo para sus servicios religiosos presenciales  el pastor no supo cómo fue recibido su sermón. La asistencia fue escasa y era difícil percibir si sus bromas tenían algún efecto  o si su congregación —compuesta por grupos familiares que estaban separados por tres asientos y otras personas que lo veían por internet— seguía atenta. Así que le sorprendió cuando dos miembros de la iglesia manifestaron su inquietud por la breve referencia que hizo el pastor sobre Hanks. Una joven le mandó un mensaje de texto muy preocupada; otra persona insinuó que la referencia a Hanks era una prueba de que a Thompson no le importaba el tema del tráfico sexual. El pastor pronto se percató de que esos temores eran producto de la extendida teoría conspirativa de QAnon  la cual afirma que esa estrella de cine forma parte de una red de pedófilos de Hollywood. Durante décadas  Thompson  de 44 años  había estado seguro de que conocía a la población de Fort Smith  una ciudad pequeña escondida bajo un recodo del rio Arkansas a lo largo de la frontera de Oklahoma. Thompson nació en el hospital más antiguo de esa ciudad  asistió a escuelas públicas de la localidad y se crio en una iglesia bautista que lo alentó a comenzar a predicar cuando era adolescente. Thompson supuso que viviría en Fort Smith por el resto de su vida. Pero ahora ya no estaba tan seguro. “Jesús habla de cómo él es la verdad  de lo importante que es la verdad”  dijo Thompson en una entrevista. “Cuando pierdes la noción de verdad  has perdido todo”.

Si últimamente estás pasando mucho tiempo en internet —y debido a la pandemia muchos de nosotros lo estamos haciendo— tal vez hayas oído de QAnon  la teoría de conspiración en internet que está creciendo y que ha atraído a algunos de los simpatizantes del presidente estadounidense  Donald Trump. No obstante  a menos que estés demasiado tiempo en línea  quizá todavía tengas preguntas sobre qué está pasando en realidad. Alguna vez  QAnon fue un fenómeno marginal  del tipo que la mayoría de la gente puede ignorar con facilidad. Sin embargo  en estos últimos meses  se ha vuelto popular. Twitter  Facebook y otras redes sociales han sido inundadas con información falsa relacionada con QAnon sobre la COVID-19  las protestas de Black Lives Matter y la elección presidencial de 2020 en Estados Unidos. Los simpatizantes de QAnon también han intentado vincularse a otras causas de activismo  tales como los movimientos antivacunas y las campañas contra el tráfico de menores  en un esfuerzo por hacer crecer sus filas. QAnon también ha permeado el mundo real  ya que algunas de las personas que creen en ella han enfrentado cargos por crímenes violentos  incluido un seguidor de QAnon acusado de asesinar a un capo de la mafia en Nueva York el año pasado y otro que fue arrestado en abril y acusado de amenazar con matar a Joe Biden  el candidato presidencial demócrata. El FBI ha advertido que QAnon representa una potencial amenaza terrorista nacional. La semana pasada  QAnon logró un nuevo hito cuando Marjorie Taylor Greene  una simpatizante declarada de QAnon de Georgia  ganó una elección primaria republicana en un distrito altamente conservador  lo que la perfila para una victoria casi segura en la elección al Congreso de noviembre. Después de la victoria de Greene  Trump la describió como una “futura estrella republicana”. QAnon es una teoría increíblemente complicada y explicar sus corrientes y subteorías podría llenar un libro entero. No obstante  a continuación presentamos algunas cuestiones básicas que debes saber.

Like the biblical character  Mr. Bankman-Fried’s symbolic shearing for his courtroom appearance may become a fabled reflection of promise brought low in the tales to come of our digital age. As Mr. Bankman-Fried took the stand on Friday in federal court in Manhattan to begin testifying in his own defense — to explain his actions as having been made in good faith  even if they had bad results — it was hard not to think that his newly cropped do  created by a fellow jail inmate  according to a person familiar with the situation  and paired with a subdued gray suit  white shirt and purple tie  wasn’t just a dress code choice  but a metaphor. An apologia writ in hair about what happens when a muscular intellect is married to frail corporate governance. Why not? Everyone (or every juror) can see a hairdo and relate. Cryptocurrency  not so much. Besides  from the beginning it was by Mr. Bankman-Fried’s hair that so many knew him. The wild halo of dark curls that looked as if it had never met a brush and  according to Michael Lewis in “Going Infinite ” his new book about Mr. Bankman-Fried and FTX  resembled “the hairdo of a lunatic.” The hair that suggested Einstein  electric sockets and some sort of giant brain underneath. The hair that  along with the wrinkled cargo shorts and T-shirts that were Mr. Bankman-Fried’s everyday uniform  suggested “the ultimate billionaire white boy tech flex: I’m so above convention ” as Scott Galloway  an investor  podcast host and professor of marketing  once told The New York Times.

Mr. Zhao pleaded guilty last year to a money-laundering violation  acknowledging that his company allowed terrorist groups and other criminals to have access to its platform. Defense lawyers asked for probation without any prison time  while prosecutors requested a three-year sentence  calling it an “unprecedented” crime. But Judge Richard A. Jones  who oversaw the case in U.S. District Court in Seattle  said in court on Tuesday that Mr. Zhao had taken responsibility for his offenses and was unlikely to break the law again. “Your conduct does not warrant a 36-month sentence ” Judge Jones said. He called Mr. Zhao “a dedicated family man and a giving person” and praised his “staggering accomplishment” in building Binance.

For believers  it was a moment of vindication after a 2022 industry downturn that sent several major companies into bankruptcy and tainted crypto’s reputation. But is crypto really back from the dead? While the numbers suggest the industry is starting to thrive again  there are major differences between this bull run and the euphoria that drove crypto prices to previous highs. Here’s what to know about the new crypto surge. Why did cryptocurrencies collapse in the past? The last time Bitcoin hit a record was November 2021  as cryptocurrencies became a cultural phenomenon. Crypto executives hung out with celebrities  and their companies conducted giant marketing campaigns featuring Super Bowl commercials. Prices crashed in the spring of 2022 as some of the most prominent crypto firms were exposed as frauds. People who had poured their savings into crypto lost everything. The decline culminated in November 2022 when the FTX crypto exchange  founded by Sam Bankman-Fried  collapsed after the equivalent of a bank run  costing customers $8 billion. Since then  Bitcoin has been on a tear. After hitting a low of roughly $16 000 after FTX’s implosion  the virtual currency’s price has soared to $69 000. How did Bitcoin rebound? A major turning point for the crypto industry arrived in August when a court ruling paved the way for financial firms to offer new investment products tied to the price of Bitcoin. The products  called exchange-traded funds  or E.T.F.s  gave investors a way to dabble in cryptocurrencies without owning them directly. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

As the supply falls  some analysts anticipate that the digital currency’s price will soar. These reductions happen every four years or so. But this year’s halving has drawn especially enthusiastic attention as the crypto industry rebounds from years of falling prices and corporate implosions. In recent months  Bitcoin’s price has surged to record highs  reaching $73 000 in March. Much of that increase was driven by the approval of new financial products tied to Bitcoin  which spurred billions of dollars in new investment. Crypto investors are hoping that the halving will create a similar effect  causing Bitcoin’s price to climb further. Here’s what to know about the halving. How does the halving work? A key purpose of Bitcoin is to enable people to exchange money without any sort of intermediary  like a bank  verifying the transaction. In place of a bank  a distributed network of computers scattered around the world  all running Bitcoin’s software  performs the verification. To confirm a transaction  the computers solve complicated puzzles  racing one another to guess the answer. This process is designed to ensure that Person A has sufficient funds to send money to Person B. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Here’s What You Should Know. - The New York Times","2024-01-19T14:00:12.000Z","By Tara Siegel Bernard","Federal regulators have made it easier for everyday investors to buy funds that track the price of Bitcoin, using traditional brokerage accounts. Most financial advisers remain skeptical.","Nearly a dozen new investments funds that hold Bitcoin began trading last week  making it easier for anyone with a basic brokerage account to buy a slice of the digital currency. Several established financial institutions  including Fidelity and BlackRock  have coalesced around Bitcoin because it is the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency. But Bitcoin remains an enigma to most everyday investors  and it’s hard to separate the buzz from any true potential. It’s also wildly volatile. In other words  it’s a bet. And institutions are wagering that plenty of investors want in. But putting crypto into a traditional investment wrapper does not paper over the underlying risks. Here’s a look at how it works: What is an exchange-traded fund? Exchange-traded funds are similar to mutual funds  but they can be traded on an exchange like a stock. E.T.F.s track the performance of the assets they hold  which might include a diversified basket of securities like stock or bonds  or even single commodities  like gold  silver and crypto. They were initially designed to track indexes (like the S&P 500) or spheres of the market  and were heralded for their low costs and tax efficiency. But they’ve grown in popularity in recent years. Many E.T.F.s now track narrower and more esoteric slices of the markets  while others use leverage to magnify bets on a specific stock or sector or the market overall. What is a Bitcoin E.T.F.? The Bitcoin exchange-traded products that recently started trading are designed to track Bitcoin’s price  minus the fees and cost of trading. This throws open the gates to any investors with a traditional brokerage account who can now buy the shares as if they were buying stock in Apple or Google.

The mayors also want to use buzzy new tech like NFTs to raise money for public projects.","Scott Conger  the mayor of Jackson  Tenn.  campaigned on a modest promise to improve local infrastructure. He planned to build sidewalks  open a senior center and repair the aging storm-water disposal system in his city of 68 000  about halfway between Nashville and Memphis. But as he begins his fourth year in office  Mr. Conger  38  has adopted a new favorite cause: cryptocurrencies. He has pledged to give city employees the option of converting their paychecks into Bitcoin and has outlined plans to install a digital mining network in a deserted wing of City Hall. The aim  he said  is to make Jackson a Southeastern tech center. Like many Americans  Mr. Conger discovered crypto during the pandemic and soon fell down an internet rabbit hole. His plans have turned him into something of a celebrity in the crypto world  a strange distinction for the leader of a midsize industrial hub where Pringles potato chips are manufactured. “Bitcoin is a great financial equalizer ” Mr. Conger declared this month in an interview at City Hall. “It’s a hedge against inflation. It can bridge that wealth gap.” The ballooning popularity of Bitcoin and other digital currencies has given rise to a strange new political breed: the crypto mayor. Eric Adams  New York’s new mayor  accepted his first paycheck in Bitcoin and another cryptocurrency  Ether. Francis Suarez  Miami’s mayor  headlines crypto conferences. Now even mayors of smaller towns are trying to incorporate crypto into municipal government  courting start-ups and experimenting with buzzy new technologies like nonfungible tokens  or NFTs  to raise money for public projects. Their growing ranks reflect the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital currencies  which are highly volatile and have fallen in value in recent days. The mayors’ embrace of crypto is also a recognition that its underlying blockchain technology — essentially a distributed ledger system — may create new revenue streams for cities and reshape some basic functions of local government.

For more than 10 years  tourism advertisements have painted California as a place for dreamers  a place for adventure and testing your limits by surfing  rock-climbing and skiing. The state tourism agency  Visit California  led the campaign  which invited people from around the world to “Dream Big” and travel to the Golden State. Not anymore. This spring  Visit California replaced “Dream Big” with a new campaign and a new brand for the state  as the “Ultimate Playground.” The scenes in the ads are much the same as before — with the addition of the Rady Shell  San Diego’s outdoor concert venue that opened in 2021 — but there’s no longer any mention of dreams. Caroline Beteta  the chief executive of Visit California  told me there were a number of reasons for the switch  including that branding phrases like “Dream Big” tend to lose power over time and that the concept of dreaming had been popping up elsewhere  in corporate advertising. Another major driver of the “Ultimate Playground” campaign was a more polarized political climate across the United States  which has created antipathy toward California in some parts of the country. Beteta told me that the agency’s consumer research confirmed that Americans increasingly see the world through a political lens  and that framing California as a place to dream about was striking some viewers as a political statement. “Ultimate Playground” seemed to be a safer and less charged message.

They both have round heads  dark eyes  tiny beaks and bodies covered in mottled brown and white feathers. But the birds  which are found in California and the Pacific Northwest  face two very different fates. The barred owl is native to eastern North America  and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service considers it to be invasive on the West Coast. The agency has proposed eradicating up to half a million barred owls in Washington  Oregon and California over the next 30 years. Federal officials say that such drastic action is necessary because the barred owl has been encroaching on the territory of the spotted owl for half a century. Populations of the northern spotted owl  a subspecies native to the Pacific Northwest  have declined by as much as 80 percent over the past two decades. There’s concern that the northern spotted owl  which is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act  may eventually become extinct. In the Golden State  barred owls have also emerged as a threat to the California spotted owl  a subspecies closely related to the northern spotted owl  in the Sierra Nevada and the mountains of coastal Southern California.

Littered across the lawn was a mass of trampled tents  sleeping bags  pizza boxes  blankets and poles. Just hours earlier  as protesters chanted and sprayed fire extinguishers  police officers in riot gear tore down the pro-Palestinian encampment that had dominated a well-known quad at the university for a week. About 200 people were arrested and booked after a standoff with the authorities  according to Nicole Nishida  a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Most were charged with misdemeanors such as unlawful assembly  she said  and the majority had been released by midmorning. About 300 protesters left voluntarily  according to the university. Students and faculty have been left struggling to comprehend their university’s response during two days of disorder that disrupted a campus that had supported free speech as long as things remained peaceful. Earlier this week  a violent overnight brawl between those in the encampment and dozens of counterprotesters ended only after Los Angeles authorities finally arrived. The melee had included fistfights  chemicals sprayed into the air and people being kicked or beaten with poles. Many of the participants did not include students. No arrests were made that night. “We’d like some transparency from within the administration and within law enforcement  given the delays and inconsistencies in reaction ” said Jeremy Zwick  a third-year history major at U.C.L.A. “It was a frustrating strategy to witness  and it definitely caused a lot of confusion.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

But how?","Desperate to stem protests that have convulsed campuses across the country  a small number of universities have agreed to reconsider their investments in companies that do business with Israel. The deals  which have eased tension on campuses with only a few days left before students break for the summer  would have been unthinkable even a week ago. And they’re a gamble  potentially putting universities on a collision course with influential donors  politicians and students who support Israel. The schools are still far from pulling money: Brown University  the liberal Ivy League institution  agreed this week only to hold a board vote this fall on whether its $6.6 billion endowment should divest from any Israeli-connected holdings. In exchange  the pro-Palestinian encampment on the campus's main lawn was dismantled. Northwestern University and the University of Minnesota have also struck deals with student protesters to clear camps in exchange for a commitment to discuss the schools’ investment policies around Israel. The moves could add pressure on administrators at Columbia University  the University of Michigan and the University of North Carolina  among others  where protesters have made divestment from Israel a central rallying cry. The issue of financial divestment from Israel has long been an untouchable one  both in American politics and among the Wall Street titans who manage university endowments and make up a large source of donations. Taking sides now is a surefire way to inflame at least one faction in a conflict that has divided campuses  split the Democratic Party and handed Republican lawmakers a cudgel with which to attack the institutions. Even the renewed talk of divestment has raised alarms among the well-heeled donors whom few universities dare cross  and who have exerted influence over the debate on college campuses since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the subsequent invasion of Gaza. Billionaires  including the fund manager William A. Ackman and Marc Rowan  a private-equity chieftain  mounted campaigns to remove the presidents of Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania over their handling of antisemitism on their campuses.

Occupying buildings? Demonstrators cite their right to free expression, but the issues are thorny.","Follow our live coverage of the college protests at U.C.L.A. and other universities. Protesters on college campuses have often cited the First Amendment as shelter for their tactics  whether they were simply waving signs or taking more dramatic steps  like setting up encampments  occupying buildings or chanting slogans that critics say are antisemitic. But many legal scholars  along with university lawyers and administrators  believe at least some of those free-speech assertions muddle  misstate  test or even flout the amendment  which is meant to guard against state suppression. Whose interpretation and principles prevail  whether in the courts or among the administrators in charge of meting out discipline  will do much to determine whether protesters face punishments for campus turmoil. The First Amendment doesn’t automatically apply at private schools. Public universities  as arms of government  must yield to the First Amendment and how the courts interpret its decree that there shall be no law “abridging the freedom of speech” or “the right of the people peaceably to assemble.” But private universities set their own standards around speech and protest. To be sure  private universities tend to embrace free expression more than  say  private businesses. Those policies and approaches  though  are driven by principles like academic freedom and the marketplace of ideas  not constitutional law. Columbia University  a hub through this round of campus protests and the scene of an enormous police response on Tuesday night  has not forbidden all speech. But its current policy includes a set of rules  such as permissible demonstration zones and preregistration of protests  that the university says are intended to ensure safety while promising that “all members of the university community have the right to speak  study  research  teach and express their own views.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

This year  that’s not necessarily the case. Because of a disastrous rollout of the new application for federal tuition aid  many still don’t know how much tuition they would be paying and so have not decided where they can afford to go. The Education Department’s redesigned form for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid  or FAFSA  was supposed to make applying for tuition aid easier and more accessible. But faced with a bureaucratic mess caused by technical meltdowns and severe delays in processing information and receiving aid packages  students say the new system has been anything but clear or streamlined. The first signs of trouble began in December with the form’s release and have cascaded since  creating uncertainties for students — with graduation right around the corner. “It’s been a nightmare from point A to point B ” said Reyna Atkinson  a 17-year-old from Michigan  who ultimately committed to Michigan State University after months of waiting. FAFSA is a free  standardized application for federal aid for college tuition that millions rely on.

Lieutenant Richard Davis of the U.C.L.A. campus police said the protesters arrested in a campus parking deck were charged with conspiracy to attempt burglary. A U.C.L.A. spokesman later said that 44 people had been taken into custody. The arrests came as pro-Palestinian demonstrators attempted a sit-in at Moore Hall  student organizers said. About 30 protesters were sitting in a corner of the parking deck around 9:45 a.m. local time  with their hands zip tied behind them. They were later taken to a sheriff’s bus. Image Students being arrested on the U.C.L.A. campus on Monday.Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York Times The university sent a message telling students and faculty members to avoid Moore Hall and switched to remote classes. Another group of demonstrators amassed in nearby Dodd Hall  where about 40 were inside on Monday morning  chanting  “Disclose  divest  we will not stop  we will not rest.” They later moved outdoors to Bruin Plaza near the center of campus  where about 150 protesters had gathered by late morning. U.C.L.A. administrators originally took a tolerant approach to a pro-Palestinian encampment at the school  even as student protesters were arrested across the nation. But the peace was shattered late Tuesday: Videos analyzed by The New York Times showed pro-Israeli counterprotesters attacking students in the encampment  beating them with sticks  using chemical sprays and launching fireworks as weapons. No arrests have been made in connection with the attack  which the police allowed to continue for hours without intervention. But on Thursday  police officers from three law enforcement agencies arrested more than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators and dismantled their camp. The university said on Sunday that it had created a new campus safety position as it examines what led to clashes between demonstrators there.","U.S.","Not related to Blockchain"

The arrests and aggressive efforts to clamp down on protests underscored just how tumultuous the end of the spring semester has been for universities  many of which are now holding commencements this weekend against the backdrop of tense protests on their campuses. The turmoil has added another complicated layer to graduation for students  many of whom had their high school senior-year celebrations abruptly cut short by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Pro-Palestinian students and their allies  for their part  have signaled that they will continue to challenge their universities over their financial ties to Israel and military companies  to express outrage over the violence in Gaza and to condemn aggressive treatment of protesters on campus. “We aren’t going anywhere ” said Bryce Greene  26  an Indiana University doctoral student and one of the protest organizers at the school’s campus in Bloomington. Mr. Greene said he believed there would be enough students around campus to sustain the protest over the summer  or until the school agreed to their demands to divest. The arrests at the University of Virginia  in Charlottesville  were among the most prominent on Saturday  after weeks of unrest across the country. In a news release  the university said the protesters had violated school policy on Friday by setting up tents on the lawn and by using megaphones.

Video clips published by the Mississippi Free Press and The Daily Mississippian showed some of the men  who had gathered to counter a pro-Palestinian protest on the school’s campus in Oxford  Miss.  directing derogatory  racist and profane remarks at the Black student. One man appeared to hoot and make monkey gestures at her. “The behavior captured in that video is undignified  and it’s just racist  period ” said Karine Jean-Pierre  the first Black woman to serve as White House press secretary  during a press briefing on Tuesday. “It is beneath anyone — anyone — to be sharing that kind of material ” she added. “The actions in the video are beneath any American  and so it is insulting to everyone who has to view it.” At least one student now faces a conduct investigation at the university  Glenn F. Boyce  the school chancellor  said on Friday. He did not identify the student  citing privacy laws  and did not rule out the possibility of more investigations. “Some statements made were offensive  hurtful and unacceptable  including actions that conveyed hostility and racist overtones ” he wrote in a letter to campus. He added  “People who say horrible things to people because of who they are will not find shelter or comfort on this campus.” On Sunday  the headquarters of Phi Delta Theta fraternity said it had removed one person from its membership  adding that the “racist actions” shown in the video clip were “those of an individual and are antithetical to the values of Phi Delta Theta and the Mississippi Alpha chapter.” The fraternity also did not identify the student. While other videos showing the counterprotesters loudly singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” were celebrated online  the videos of the taunts have been widely condemned. Representative Mike Collins  Republican of Georgia  captioned a post with the video of the taunting as “Ole Miss taking care of business.” He later clarified in a statement that “if that person is found to have treated another human being improperly because of their race  they should be punished appropriately  and will hopefully seek forgiveness. “Frankly  I did not believe that to be the focal point of the video shared at the time ” he said. “But I recognize that there certainly seems to be some potentially inappropriate behavior that none of us should seek to glorify.”","U.S.","Not related to Blockchain"

Peters and Jamie Kelter Davis","The university’s president sent in the police to dismantle encampments, which he said had disrupted campus life. Protesters say the school is being hypocritical.","The University of Chicago has built a brand around the idea that its students should be unafraid to encounter ideas or opinions they disagree with. To drum that in  the school provides incoming students with copies of its 2015 free-speech declaration  known as the Chicago statement  which states that freedom of expression is an “essential element” of its culture. And the university has long adhered to a policy of institutional neutrality  which strongly discourages divesting from companies for political reasons  or from making statements aligning it with a social cause. That neutrality  the university argues  allows for a robust  unencumbered exchange of ideas. Many professors swell with pride talking about how the school’s commitment to these principles has endured through two world wars  Vietnam and  more recently  the tumult of the Trump administration. And more than 100 institutions have adopted or endorsed similar principles. But the University of Chicago’s image as the citadel of free speech is being tested again — this time over an encampment on its central quad  where protesters of Israel’s war in Gaza defied orders to leave for more than a week. On Tuesday morning  the university called in police to bring down dozens of tents. When the encampment first went up last week  Paul Alivisatos  the university’s president  said the school wanted to show “the greatest leeway possible for free expression ” and allowed the tents to stay up  even though they were in defiance of a policy against erecting structures in public spaces.

Peters","Roger Ailes understood the appeal Mr. Trump had for Fox viewers. He didn’t foresee how together they would redefine the limits of political discourse.","When Roger Ailes ran CNBC in the mid-1990s  he gave himself a talk show called “Straight Forward.” It long ago vanished into the void of canceled cable programs and never received much attention after the network boss moved on to produce more provocative and polarizing content as chairman of Fox News. But “Straight Forward” was a fascinating window into what kind of people Mr. Ailes considered stars. Donald Trump was one of them. In late 1995  Mr. Ailes invited Mr. Trump  then a 49-year-old developer of condos and casinos  on the show and sounded a bit star-struck as he asked his guest to explain how a Manhattan multimillionaire could be so popular with blue-collar Americans. “The guy on the street  the cabdrivers  the guys working on the road crews go  ‘Hey  Donald! How’s it going?’” Mr. Ailes observed while the two men sat in front of a wood-paneled set piece that gave the studio the appearance of an elegant den in an Upper East Side apartment. “It’s almost like they feel very comfortable with you  like you’re one of them. And I’ve never quite figured out how you bridge that.” Mr. Trump answered by flipping his host’s assertion around. It was because of who hated him: other people with money. “The people that don’t like me are the rich people. It’s a funny thing. They can’t stand me ” Mr. Trump said  adding  “I sort of love it.” What Mr. Ailes sensed about Mr. Trump’s popularity with middle- and working-class Americans in the 1990s would stay with him  because he identified with it. “A lot of what we do at Fox is blue collar stuff ” he said in 2011. His understanding of those dynamics helped shape the coverage he directed for decades and led to an embrace of grievance-oriented political rhetoric that the Republican Party  and a further fragmented right-wing media landscape  is grappling with as it looks toward elections this fall and the possibility of Mr. Trump returning to politics.

That evidence never emerged but a new culprit in a supposed scheme to rig the election did: Dominion Voting Systems  a maker of election technology whose algorithms  Mr. Dobbs said  “were designed to be inaccurate.” Maria Bartiromo  another host on the network  falsely stated that “Nancy Pelosi has an interest in this company.” Jeanine Pirro  a Fox News personality  speculated that “technical glitches” in Dominion’s software “could have affected thousands of absentee mail-in ballots.” Those unfounded accusations are now among the dozens cited in Dominion’s defamation lawsuit against the Fox Corporation  which alleges that Fox repeatedly aired false  far-fetched and exaggerated allegations about Dominion and its purported role in a plot to steal votes from Mr. Trump. Those bogus assertions — made day after day  including allegations that Dominion was a front for the communist government in Venezuela and that its voting machines could switch votes from one candidate to another — are at the center of the libel suit  one of the most extraordinary brought against an American media company in more than a generation. First Amendment scholars say the case is a rarity in libel law. Defamation claims typically involve a single disputed statement. But Dominion’s complaint is replete with example after example of false statements  many of them made after the facts were widely known. And such suits are often quickly dismissed  because of the First Amendment’s broad free speech protections and the high-powered lawyers available to a major media company like Fox. If they do go forward  they are usually settled out of court to spare both sides the costly spectacle of a trial. But Dominion’s $1.6 billion case against Fox has been steadily progressing in Delaware state court this summer  inching ever closer to trial. There have been no moves from either side toward a settlement  according to interviews with several people involved in the case. The two companies are deep into document discovery  combing through years of each other’s emails and text messages  and taking depositions. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Peters and Maggie Haberman","Fox News leaned on the former president privately and publicly to join the debate. But all the while he was proceeding with a plan for his own counterprogramming.","On a cool August night on the crowded patio of his private club in New Jersey  former President Donald J. Trump held up his phone to his dinner companions. The Republican front-runner was having dinner with a Fox News contributor and columnist  Charlie Hurt  when a call came in from another member of the Fox team. The man on the other end of the line  Mr. Trump was delighted to show his guests  was Bret Baier  one of the two moderators of the first Republican debate on Wednesday  according to two people with knowledge of the call. It was Mr. Trump’s second Fox dinner that week. The night before  he had hosted the Fox News president  Jay Wallace  and the network’s chief executive  Suzanne Scott  who had gone to Bedminster  N.J.  hoping to persuade Mr. Trump to attend the debate. Mr. Baier was calling to get a feel for the former president’s latest thinking. For months  Fox had been working Mr. Trump privately and publicly. He was keeping them guessing  in his patented petulant way. But even as he behaved as if he was listening to entreaties  Mr. Trump was proceeding with a plan for his own counterprogramming to the debate. The former president has told aides that he has made up his mind not to participate in the debate and has decided to post an online interview with Tucker Carlson that night instead. The interview with Mr. Carlson has already been taped  according to a person with direct knowledge of the event. On Sunday  Mr. Trump confirmed his plans  posting on his website  Truth Social  that he was skipping the debate because he’s leading his rivals in polling and because the public knows “what a successful Presidency I had.” Upstaging Fox’s biggest event of the year would be provocation enough. But an interview with Mr. Carlson — who was Fox’s top-rated prime-time host and is at war with the network  which is still paying out his contract — amounts to a slap in the network’s face by Mr. Trump. The decision is a potential source of aggravation for the Republican National Committee chairwoman  Ronna McDaniel  who privately urged him to attend  including in her own visit to Bedminster last month.

Bromwich, Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Swan","Hope Hicks, once a spokeswoman for Donald J. Trump, broke down in tears on the witness stand as she talked about their time together.","Her voice low  her posture tense  the woman who spent years steering Donald J. Trump through strife and scandal stepped to the witness stand on Friday carrying a different burden. She was there under the fluorescent lights of a dreary Manhattan courtroom  seated 15 feet from the former president she once fiercely defended  to testify at his criminal trial. “I’m really nervous ” Hope Hicks  the onetime Trump spokeswoman  messaging maestro and all-around adviser  acknowledged to the prosecutor questioning her  declaring what was already obvious to the riveted courtroom. Ms. Hicks’s unease came to a head hours later as Mr. Trump’s lawyer began to cross-examine her — and she began to cry. As her voice cracked  Mr. Trump locked his eyes on her. The question that initially unnerved Ms. Hicks was about her time at the Trump Organization  the family’s business  where she had fond memories of working. Ms. Hicks left the stand  and the trial paused so that she could compose herself. She returned minutes later to continue her testimony  occasionally dabbing her eyes with a tissue. The striking show of emotion reflected Ms. Hicks’s discomfort with testifying against a man who launched her career and entrusted her with his reputation. Each time the questioning conjured up another memory of working for Mr. Trump — at his company  on his campaign and finally in his White House — Ms. Hicks appeared to fight back tears. Ms. Hicks  who fell out of favor with Mr. Trump once it emerged that she had privately voiced anger at the Jan. 6  2021  attack on the Capitol by his supporters  said in her testimony that they had not spoken in nearly two years.

Bromwich","Donald J. Trump’s books provided prosecutors with passages they believe can help their case, as they argue that he knew that his company falsified business records to cover up a hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels.","Prosecutors cannot force Donald J. Trump to testify at his criminal trial in Manhattan  but that does not mean they can’t use his words against him. On Tuesday  the prosecutors unearthed a series of damaging excerpts from books that the former president wrote  plucking out passages to help make their case against Mr. Trump. In essence  they called a past version of Mr. Trump to testify against his future self. In his own words  Mr. Trump described how he kept a focus on minute details and watched every penny that left his accounts  corroborating a core component of the prosecution’s case as they argue that he knew that his company falsified business records to cover up a hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels  a porn star. On cross-examination  Mr. Trump’s lawyer  Todd Blanche  suggested that a ghost writer had been responsible for these words. Mr. Trump’s written words also described how he sees sexual potential in women that he encounters  a salient point in a trial tethered to encounters with women that he is accused of covering up. “All the women on ‘The Apprentice’ flirted with me ” he wrote. Prosecutors introduced the damning excerpts by questioning Sally Franklin  a witness who is an executive and editor  to read excerpts from “Trump: How to Get Rich” and “Trump: Think Like a Billionaire ” both of which were published by Ballantine  a Penguin Random House imprint. The jury heard Trump’s written words: “Every dollar counts in business  and for that matter  every dime.” The text continued  “Even in high end shops  I bargain ” adding  “I hate paying retail.” This was not the first time jurors heard Trump in his own words. Last week  prosecutors played video clips of him talking  and they have questioned witnesses about Mr. Trump’s infamous statement on the set of “Access Hollywood” that he would grab women by the genitals. But the judge would not allow prosecutors to play the tape for jurors  a decision that elevated the importance of the book passages  or any other opportunity to use Mr. Trump as a witness against himself. It might not be the only opportunity for jurors to hear from the former president. Although the prosecution cannot legally call him to testify  Mr. Trump could take the witness stand in his own defense  though it is unclear whether he will do so. For now  jurors heard his words via Ms. Franklin  who read ominous passages in which Mr. Trump spoke of how he treated his perceived enemies. “For many years I’ve said that if someone screws you  screw them back ” she read from a book by Mr. Trump. It continued: “When somebody hurts you  just go after them as viciously and as violently as you can. Like it says in the Bible  an eye for an eye.” As jurors listened  Mr. Trump’s smiling image on a book cover was plastered on screens across the courtroom  a sharp contrast from the scowl he sported throughout the testimony.","New York","Not related to Blockchain"

Trump’s Monday began with a grave warning from Juan M. Merchan  the judge presiding over the former president’s criminal trial  threatening to imprison him if he continued to flout a gag order. Justice Merchan said that the fines levied against Mr. Trump — $10 000 so far — “are not serving as a deterrent.” The judge said that “therefore  going forward  this court will have to consider jail.” That warning preceded a desert-dry description of a $130 000 payment made by Mr. Trump’s fixer  Michael D. Cohen  to a porn star to buy her silence about her story of a one-night stand in 2006. That testimony was elicited from two employees  one current and one retired  of the Trump Organization. The former president is accused of falsifying business records to cover up that $130 000 payment. Mr. Trump  77  the first American president to face criminal prosecution  has denied the charges and says he did not have sex with the woman  Stormy Daniels. If convicted  he could face prison time or probation. Here are five takeaways from Mr. Trump’s 12th day on trial: Trump’s comments continue to bring him trouble. Justice Merchan once again found Mr. Trump in contempt for violating his gag order that prohibited attacks on jurors  witnesses  court staff and others. It was Mr. Trump’s 10th violation  and resulted from an April 22 interview in which he said the jury was from “a purely Democrat area ” calling those circumstances “very unfair.” Image Justice Juan M.

It might have been a note of condolence  or sympathy or even a tip. Instead  it was a ransom note  the state police said  one that led to the dramatic rescue later that day of the 9-year-old girl  found hidden in a cupboard in a rundown camper  just 14 miles from her home. The story of how state troopers  S.W.A.T. teams  and other law enforcement officials came to find the child  Charlotte Sena  began with a lucky break and a possible missed opportunity  followed by old-fashioned shoe leather police work. A fingerprint found on the ransom note led investigators to the suspect  who apparently dropped off the note himself — and left without being apprehended  though a trooper had been stationed at the house. The suspect  Craig Nelson Ross  Jr.  46  was arrested at his mother’s home on Monday night and charged with first-degree kidnapping on Tuesday. He pleaded not guilty; additional charges are expected  according to the State Police. Charlotte was said to be in good health and reunited with her parents for the first time since Saturday night  when a weekend camping trip was shattered by the little girl’s disappearance  a sudden vanishing that encapsulated the worst fears of parents everywhere.

Real Life Is Another Story. - The New York Times","2024-01-14T08:00:20.000Z","By Jesse McKinley","Many attempted murder plots, whether instigated by amateurs or professionals, are marred by ineptitude, experts say, despite what happens in “Goodfellas” and “The Sopranos.”","It’s a scene as old as celluloid: a shadowy figure named Luca Brasi or John Wick or Barry Berkman lurking in the darkness  outfitted with sinister intent and nifty weapons  effortlessly committing a murder for cash  animus or cold political calculations. Whether they’re called hit men  contract killers or assassins  figures who kill for a living are a staple of Hollywood thrillers — and  by extension  the public imagination. But experts in law enforcement and international espionage say that murders-for-hire are notoriously difficult to successfully arrange  let alone get away with. Take  for example  what prosecutors say was a recent foiled plot to kill a Sikh separatist in New York City  which American intelligence officials believe was ordered by the Indian government. Once the plot reached the point where the alleged conspirators needed to employ a killer  things got complicated: The would-be hit man turned out to be an undercover agent working for the U.S. government. Robert Baer  a former C.I.A. officer and the author of several books  including “The Perfect Kill: 21 Laws for Assassins ” says he has known many bad guys during his decades in law enforcement and espionage. But even he says finding a real-life killer would stump him. “I could not find you a hit man ” he said. “And I know a lot of murderers.” Dennis Kenney  a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice  concurred  calling the public perception of a slick  skilled hit man “pretty much myth ” adding that a for-hire killer is usually “nothing more than a thug who offers or agrees to a one-off payday.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

He had told a friend that he thought he was being followed  but that night  he was just eager to celebrate Father’s Day with his family. Mr. Nijjar was heading out of the parking lot in his truck when he was ambushed. Two masked gunmen unleashed a burst of gunfire and then sped off in a getaway car. Mr. Nijjar was dead. The murder that day in June became part of a chain of events that would ricochet around the world  with federal agents in the United States working furiously behind the scenes to untangle an international assassination plot that they believed was directed by someone inside India’s government. The geopolitical implications were huge  and the clock was ticking: The next murder being planned was for someone on U.S. soil. That explosive tip had come into the Drug Enforcement Administration through an unexpected avenue  according to court records and interviews with people familiar with the investigation — accounts that  taken together  provide a detailed picture of how the episode unfolded. What followed was an elaborate sting operation involving an undercover D.E.A. agent posing as a hit man and a wad of $15 000 in cash bills  overseen by a sprawling team of investigators who were able to access private text messages between Indian nationals living in India. This week  federal prosecutors in Manhattan unsealed charges against Nikhil Gupta  a resident of India who was accused of arranging the murder plot in the United States. Officials say the plot targeted a prominent Sikh American activist living in New York City who had been a longtime colleague of Mr. Nijjar  also an outspoken Sikh leader.

He denies the encounter.","For three weeks  witness after witness in Donald J. Trump’s criminal trial has spoken the name of Stormy Daniels  the porn star whose claim of a sexual encounter with the former president is at the center of the case. On Tuesday  jurors heard her tell the story herself  and Mr. Trump silently looked on. The details of the encounter have been public for years  but prosecutors brought in Ms. Daniels to give jurors her personal and explicit account of an assignation in a hotel suite nearly 18 years ago. They had Ms. Daniels describe the day she met Mr. Trump  as an attempt to bolster the credibility of a story that ultimately brought her a hush-money deal days before the 2016 election. Prosecutors say the former president’s effort to hide that payment is the crux of their criminal case against him. Ms. Daniels  45  was born Stephanie Clifford and raised in Baton Rouge  La. She was a stripper and later starred in pornographic films  becoming a valued “contract girl” for Wicked Pictures. Her encounter with Mr. Trump happened in July 2006  after he became a television star with his reality show  “The Apprentice.” On Tuesday  Ms. Daniels began by testifying about her difficult upbringing in Louisiana before turning to how she had met Mr. Trump in 2006 at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe  Nev. They met at the booth for Wicked Pictures  and there is a picture of them together there. She testified that Mr. Trump sought to have dinner with her. At the time  Mr. Trump was 60  and she was 27.

Benefit From Huge Tax Breaks - The New York Times","2023-09-26T07:00:17.000Z","By Matthew Haag and Meredith Kolodner","As New York City’s budget tightens, its wealthiest universities are bigger and richer than ever. Now, some officials think it’s time for the schools to pay more in taxes.","As Columbia University puts the last touches on its brand-new campus in Harlem  it has reached a milestone: The university is now the largest private landowner in New York City. In a city where land is more valuable than almost anywhere in the nation  the school now owns more than 320 properties  with a combined value of nearly $4 billion. The growth has helped it stay competitive within the Ivy League and meet its broader ambitions to become a global institution. By many measures  those ambitions have also helped lift the city around it  attracting higher numbers of students  producing new jobs and boosting New York’s reputation as an international center of knowledge. But as Columbia has expanded its footprint  it has also become more of a drain on the city budget because of a state law more than 200 years old that allows universities  museums and other nonprofits to pay almost no property taxes. The law saves Columbia more than $182 million annually  according to an analysis by The New York Times. The amount has soared from $38 million just 15 years ago as the university has bought up more properties and their value has increased. Columbia’s property tax savings  which are a fraction of its $14.3 billion endowment  far exceed the tax breaks granted to many high-profile commercial developments  including large-scale sites like Hudson Yards. They are 50 percent larger than those at Yankee Stadium and greater than the combined tax deals for Citi Field and Madison Square Garden. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Manhattan May Never Be the Same. - The New York Times","2021-03-29T07:00:10.000Z","By Matthew Haag","New York City, long buoyed by the flow of commuters into its towering office buildings, faces a cataclysmic challenge, even when the pandemic ends.","Spotify’s headquarters in the United States fills 16 floors of 4 World Trade Center  a towering office building in Lower Manhattan that was the first to rise on the site of the 2001 terror attacks. Its offices will probably never be full again: Spotify has told employees they can work anywhere  even in another state. A few floors down  MediaMath  an advertising tech company  is planning to abandon its space  a decision fueled by its new remote-work arrangements during the pandemic. In Midtown Manhattan  Salesforce  whose name adorns a 630-foot building overlooking Bryant Park  expects workers to be in the office just one to three days a week. A nearby law firm  Lowenstein Sandler  is weighing whether to renew its lease on its Avenue of the Americas office  where 140 lawyers used to work five days a week. “I could find few people  including myself  who think we are going to go back to the way it was ” said Joseph J. Palermo  the firm’s chief operating officer. A year after the coronavirus sparked an extraordinary exodus of workers from office buildings  what had seemed like a short-term inconvenience is now clearly becoming a permanent and tectonic shift in how and where people work. Employers and employees have both embraced the advantages of remote work  including lower office costs and greater flexibility for employees  especially those with families. Beyond New York  some of the country’s largest cities have yet to see a substantial return of employees  even where there have been less stringent government-imposed lockdowns  and some companies have announced that they are not going to have all workers come back all the time.

That could devastate building owners and cities.","As office vacancies climb to their highest levels in decades with businesses giving up office space and embracing remote work  the real estate industry in many American cities faces a potentially grave threat. Businesses have discovered during the pandemic that they can function with nearly all of their workers out of the office  an arrangement many intend to continue in some form. That could wallop the big property companies that build and own office buildings — and lead to a sharp pullback in construction  steep drops in office rents  fewer people frequenting restaurants and stores  and potentially perilous declines in the tax revenue of city governments and school districts. In only a year  the market value of office towers in Manhattan  home to the country’s two largest central business districts  has plummeted 25 percent  according to city projections released on Wednesday  contributing to an estimated $1 billion drop-off in property tax revenue. JPMorgan Chase  Ford Motor  Salesforce  Target and more are giving up expensive office space  and others are considering doing so. Jamie Dimon  chief executive of JPMorgan Chase  the largest private-sector employer in New York City  wrote in a letter to shareholders this week that remote work would “significantly reduce our need for real estate.” For every 100 employees  he said  his bank “may need seats for only 60 on average.” And just as Coca-Cola’s profits would take a seismic hit if consumers abruptly cut back on sodas  owners of office buildings  many of which are owned by pension funds  insurance companies  individuals and other investors  could be pummeled if many businesses rent less space. “The pandemic has proven that work from home is viable ” said Jonathan Litt  chief investment officer of Land & Buildings  a real estate investment firm that has taken a bearish view of the New York office market. “It’s not going away; businesses are going to adjust  and office real estate is going to take it on the chin during that adjustment period.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Experts explain how that can often be before a woman knows she is pregnant.","By the time a woman is considered six weeks pregnant  she would have had two weeks  at most  to realize it. That’s because the gestational age of a fetus is counted not from the moment that sperm fertilizes an egg or from the moment you have a positive pregnancy test  but weeks earlier  on the first day of the previous menstrual cycle. This means that just two weeks after a missed period  a woman is six weeks pregnant  said Dr. Dawnette Lewis  director of Northwell Health’s Center for Maternal Health in New York and a maternal fetal medicine specialist. That’s if someone has a typical menstrual cycle  which lasts about four weeks. But several factors — including stress  perimenopause and certain health conditions — can make the menstrual cycle so unpredictable that it could take longer than six weeks for someone to realize they might be pregnant. “People come in and they’re like  ‘I’ve always had irregular periods and I just thought I was gaining weight’ and lo and behold  they are pregnant ” said Dr. Shruthi Mahalingaiah  a fertility doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor of environmental and reproductive health at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The question of how soon it’s possible to detect and confirm a pregnancy has come into focus as new abortion restrictions have been enacted in 21 states  including in Florida  where a ban on most abortions after six weeks took effect May 1. Florida is the third state to ban abortions at this point in pregnancy.

Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, is expected to sign it on Thursday.","Arizona lawmakers voted on Wednesday to repeal an abortion ban that first became law when Abraham Lincoln was president and a half-century before women won the right to vote. A bill to repeal the law passed  16-14  in the Republican-controlled State Senate with the support of every Democratic senator and two Republicans who broke with anti-abortion conservatives who dominate their party. It now goes to Gov. Katie Hobbs  a Democrat  who is expected to sign it on Thursday. The vote was the culmination of a fevered effort to repeal the law that has made abortion a central focus of Arizona’s politics. “We are standing in a moment of Arizona history ” said State Senator Anna Hernandez  a Democrat who called the repeal measure up to a vote on Wednesday. The issue has galvanized Democratic voters and energized a campaign to put an abortion-rights ballot measure before Arizona voters in November. On the right  it created a rift between anti-abortion activists who want to keep the law in place and Republican politicians who worry about the political backlash that could be prompted by support of a near-total abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. The 1864 law had gathered dust on the books for decades. But it exploded into an election-year flashpoint three weeks ago when a 4-2 decision by the State Supreme Court  whose justices are all Republican-appointed  said the ban could now be enforced because of the overturning of Roe v.

She’s done that at The Times since 2016. As recently as the 1990s  when Jason Nageli started off  the home-building industry was still constructing what real-estate ads would brightly call the “starter home.” In the Denver area  he sold newly built two-story houses with three bedrooms in 1 400 square feet or less. The price: $99 000 to $125 000  or around $200 000 in today’s dollars. That house would be in tremendous demand today. But few builders construct anything like it anymore. And you couldn’t buy those Denver area homes built 25 years ago at an entry-level price today  either. They go for half a million dollars. The disappearance of such affordable homes is central to the American housing crisis. The nation has a deepening shortage of housing. But  more specifically  there isn’t enough of this housing: small  no-frills homes that would give a family new to the country or a young couple with student debt a foothold to build equity. The affordable end of the market has been squeezed from every side. Land costs have risen steeply in booming parts of the country. Construction materials and government fees have become more expensive. And communities nationwide are far more prescriptive today than decades ago about what housing should look like and how big it must be. Some ban vinyl siding. Others require two-car garages. Nearly all make it difficult to build the kind of home that could sell for $200 000 today. “It’s just become where you can’t get to that number anymore ” said Mr. Nageli  now the operations manager for the Utah builder Holmes Homes. Nationwide  the small detached house has all but vanished from new construction. Only about 8 percent of new single-family homes today are 1 400 square feet or less. In the 1940s  according to CoreLogic  nearly 70 percent of new houses were that small. The typical new home has grown... ...as the typical household has shrunk.

The Fed held rates steady at 5.3 percent on Wednesday  leaving them at a more than two-decade high  where they have been set since July. Central bankers reiterated that they needed “greater confidence” that inflation was coming down before reducing them. “Readings on inflation have come in above expectations ” Jerome H.

Powell  the Fed chair  said that the central bank needed “greater confidence” that inflation was coming down before it decided to cut interest rates  which are at a two-decade high. Today  the F.O.M.C. decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings  though  at a slower pace. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation  and the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance over the past year. However  in recent months  inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our 2 percent objective  and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We’ve stated that we do not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. So far this year  the data have not given us that greater confidence. In particular  and as I noted earlier  readings on inflation have come in above expectations. It is likely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected. Jerome H. Powell  the Fed chair  said that the central bank needed “greater confidence” that inflation was coming down before it decided to cut interest rates  which are at a two-decade high.CreditCredit...Susan Walsh/Associated Press The Fed stands at a complicated economic juncture. After months of rapid cooling  inflation has proved surprisingly sticky in early 2024. The Fed’s preferred inflation index has made little progress since December  and although it is down sharply from its 7.1 percent high in 2022  its current 2.7 percent is still well above the Fed’s 2 percent goal. That calls into question how soon and how much officials will be able to lower interest rates. “What we’ve said is that we need to be more confident” that inflation is coming down sufficiently and sustainably before cutting rates  Mr. Powell said. “It appears that it’s going to take longer for us to reach that point of confidence.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Is the Federal Budget Deficit Making It Worse? - The New York Times","2024-04-29T16:11:51.000Z","By Jim Tankersley","Economists are divided over whether the growing amount of federal borrowing is fueling demand and driving up prices.","A crucial question is hanging over the American economy and the fall presidential election: Why are consumer prices still growing uncomfortably fast  even after a sustained campaign by the Federal Reserve to slow the economy by raising interest rates? Economists and policy experts have offered several explanations. Some are essentially quirks of the current economic moment  like a delayed  post-pandemic surge in the cost of home and auto insurance. Others are long-running structural issues  like a lack of affordable housing that has pushed up rents in big cities like New York as would-be tenants compete for units. But some economists  including top officials at the International Monetary Fund  said that the federal government bore some of the blame because it had continued to pump large amounts of borrowed money into the economy at a time when the economy did not need a fiscal boost. That borrowing is a result of a federal budget deficit that has been elevated by tax cuts and spending increases. It is helping to fuel demand for goods and services by channeling money to companies and people who then go out and spend it. I.M.F. officials warned that the deficit was also increasing prices. In a report earlier this month  they wrote that while America’s recent economic performance was impressive  it was fueled in part by a pace of borrowing “that is out of line with long-term fiscal sustainability.” The I.M.F. said that U.S. fiscal policies were adding about a half a percentage point to the national inflation rate and raising “short-term risks to the disinflation process” — essentially saying that the government was working at cross-purposes with the Fed.

High Fed rates  a response to stubborn inflation  mean that American assets offer better returns than much of the world  and investors need dollars to buy them.

The dollar index  a common way to gauge the general strength of the U.S. currency against a basket of its major trading partners  is hovering at levels last seen in the early 2000s (when U.S. interest rates were also similarly high).

Says - The New York Times","2024-05-02T13:32:09.000Z","By Liz Alderman","The global economy has proved resilient and inflation has declined, but any widening of the conflict in the Middle East could increase price pressures and dampen growth.","Global inflation is starting to cool after aggressive campaigns by central banks to bring high prices under control  and the economic outlook is brightening after a turbulent period  but clouds loom over the recovery  according to a forecast released on Thursday. The rebound is unfolding at an uneven speed around the world  and geopolitical tensions could pose a major risk to growth and inflation — especially if the conflict in the Middle East and attacks in the Red Sea  a critical shipping zone for trade  were to widen  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  a think tank in Paris  said in its latest economic survey. “The global economy has proved resilient  inflation has declined within sight of central bank targets and risks to the outlook are becoming more balanced ” the organization’s secretary-general  Mathias Cormann  said during a news conference Thursday in Paris. “But uncertainty remains.” Inflation among the 38 O.E.C.D. member countries is expected to fall to 4.8 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2025  after hitting 9.4 percent in 2022  when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine helped set off an energy crisis. Inflation in the United States and in the euro area is expected to fall this year and next toward a 2 percent target that policymakers say is essential for maintaining the stability of prices. “We’ve been through an inflation shock of a generation ” the organization’s chief economist  Clare Lombardelli  said during the briefing. The biggest price increases have been for essential items like food and energy  she said  adding  “Those on the lowest incomes have been squeezed.” High interest rates have helped bring prices down  but there is still a risk that inflation may stay higher for longer than expected  Ms. Lombardelli said.

The dynamic is bolstering the economic health of the region and keeping the eurozone from slipping too far. In a reversal of fortunes  the laggards have become leaders. Greece  Spain and Portugal grew in 2023 more than twice as fast as the eurozone average. Italy was not far behind. Just over a decade ago  Southern Europe was the center of a eurozone debt crisis that threatened to pull apart the bloc of countries that use the euro. It has taken years to recover from deep national recessions and multibillion-dollar international bailouts with tough austerity programs. Since then  the same countries have worked to mend their finances  attracting investors  reviving growth and exports  and reversing record-high unemployment. Now Germany  Europe’s largest economy  is dragging down the region’s fortunes. It has been struggling to pull itself out of a slump set off by soaring energy prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That was clear on Tuesday  when new data showed that economic output of the euro currency bloc grew 0.3 percent in the first quarter this year from the previous quarter  according to the European Union’s statistics agency  Eurostat. The eurozone economy shrank by 0.1 percent in both the third and fourth quarters of last year  a technical recession. Germany  which accounts for one-quarter of the bloc’s economy  barely avoided a recession in the first quarter of 2024  growing 0.2 percent.

But it warned that risks remain  including stubborn inflation  the threat of escalating global conflicts and rising protectionism. In its latest World Economic Outlook report  the I.M.F. projected global output to hold steady at 3.2 percent in 2024  unchanged from 2023. Although the pace of the expansion is tepid by historical standards  the I.M.F. said that global economic activity had been surprisingly resilient given that central banks aggressively raised interest rates to tame inflation and wars in Ukraine and the Middle East further disrupt supply chains. The forecasts came as policymakers from around the world began arriving in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The outlook is brighter from just a year ago  when the I.M.F. was warning of underlying “turbulence” and a multitude of risks. Although the world economy has proved to be durable over the past year  defying predictions of a recession  there are lingering concerns that price pressures have not been sufficiently contained and that new trade barriers will be erected amid anxiety over a recent surge of cheap Chinese exports. “Somewhat worryingly  progress toward inflation targets has somewhat stalled since the beginning of the year ” Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas  the I.M.F.’s chief economist  wrote in an essay that accompanied the report. “Oil prices have been rising recently in part due to geopolitical tensions and services inflation remains stubbornly high.” He added: “Further trade restrictions on Chinese exports could also push up goods inflation.” The gathering is taking place at a time of growing tension between the United States and China over a surge of Chinese green energy products  such as electric vehicles  lithium batteries and solar panels  that are flooding global markets. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen returned last week from a trip to China  where she told her counterparts that Beijing’s industrial policy was harming American workers. She warned that the United States could pursue trade restrictions to protect investments in America’s solar and electric vehicle industries. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

But the overall financial outlook of the popular programs remained grim. Annual reports released on Monday by trustees of the old-age and retirement programs showed that both still faced long-term shortfalls that could ultimately result in reduced retirement and medical benefits. The reports showed that the Social Security and disability insurance programs  if combined  would not have enough money to pay all of their obligations in 2035. Medicare will be unable to pay all its hospital bills starting in 2036. About 70 million people receive Social Security benefits  and more than 66 million participate in Medicare. The fate of the popular programs continues to be a contentious political issue  one that is expected to intensify as the November presidential election draws near. President Biden has pledged to block any cuts to Social Security and Medicare and has called for shoring up the programs with higher taxes on the rich. Former President Donald J. Trump  the presumptive Republican nominee  suggested this year that he was open to scaling back the programs when he said there was “a lot you can do in terms of entitlements in terms of cutting.” He later walked back those comments and pledged to protect the programs. In a statement on Monday  Mr. Biden highlighted Republican proposals that would cut Social Security funding and raise the retirement age to qualify for benefits. He promised that he would be a bulwark against such policies. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

The trouble is that inflation was resilient  too. Gross domestic product  adjusted for inflation  increased at a 1.6 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year  the Commerce Department said on Thursday. That was down sharply from the 3.4 percent growth rate at the end of 2023 and fell well short of forecasters’ expectations. Economists were largely unconcerned by the slowdown  which stemmed mostly from big shifts in business inventories and international trade  components that often swing wildly from one quarter to the next. Measures of underlying demand were significantly stronger  offering no hint of the recession that forecasters spent much of last year warning was on the way. “It would suggest some moderation in growth but still a solid economy ” said Michael Gapen  chief U.S. economist at Bank of America. He said the report contained “few signs of weakness overall.” But the solid growth figures were accompanied by an unexpectedly rapid acceleration in inflation. Consumer prices rose at a 3.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter  up from 1.8 percent in the final quarter of last year. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories  prices rose at a 3.7 percent annual rate. Taken together  the first-quarter data was the latest evidence that the Federal Reserve’s efforts to tame inflation have stalled — and that the celebration in financial markets over an apparent “soft landing” or gentle slowdown for the economy had been premature.

Edward Moreno","Rates on 30-year mortgages — the most common kind among U.S. homeowners — surpassed the 7 percent mark on Thursday, a troublesome sign for an already tight housing market.","Mortgage rates rose above 7 percent for the first time this year  crossing a symbolically concerning threshold that threatens to keep millions of potential home buyers and sellers on the sidelines of a U.S. housing market that is increasingly showing signs of slowing. The average rate on 30-year mortgages  the most popular home loan in the United States  rose to 7.1 percent this week  Freddie Mac reported on Thursday  the highest since November. Mortgage rates reached a recent high of nearly 8 percent late last year — a level not seen since 2000. As mortgage rates have risen in recent months  making homeownership costlier for buyers  potential sellers who may feel locked into lower rates on their existing loans have been keeping their houses off the market  in effect pushing prices higher  too. Combined  the forces have fed into a broader feeling of frustration about the economy  at a time when inflation has remained hotter than expected. “Potential home buyers are deciding whether to buy before rates rise even more  or hold off in hopes of decreases later in the year ” Sam Khater  Freddie Mac’s chief economist  said in a statement. “It remains unclear how many home buyers can withstand increasing rates in the future.” At the same time  the market has slowed. Sales of existing homes fell by 4.3 percent in March and 3.7 percent from a year earlier  according to the National Association of Realtors. In April 2021  mortgage rates were at about 3 percent  less than half the current rate. They began to climb that year and continued to rise in 2022 when the Federal Reserve started raising its benchmark rate in an effort to combat inflation. Although inflation has since cooled significantly  it’s still above the central bank’s 2 percent target. The Fed has signaled in recent months that it may keep the cost of borrowing higher for longer amid stubborn inflation. The Fed’s benchmark interest rate is currently the highest it’s been in 22 years. Mortgage lenders generally watch the 10-year Treasury bond  which is tied to mortgage rates  and expectations that the Fed will keep rates high has pushed up Treasury yields. The 10-year Treasury yield has soared since the start of the year  now sitting at about 4.6 percent. The N.A.R. agreed to settle litigation last month that would eliminate the standard sales commission  a move housing experts say could bring down home prices. Sellers currently pay a 5 or 6 percent commission to a real estate agent  a cost that’s typically passed onto the buyer through a higher sticker price.","Business","Not related to Blockchain"

Edward Moreno and Joe Rennison","A cooler-than-expected jobs report for April shifted the tone on Wall Street, rekindling investors’ expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut rates soon.","Just as Wall Street appeared to come to terms with the idea of high interest rates sticking around for longer  a cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday brought the idea of rate cuts back into the conversation. The Labor Department reported that job and wage growth in April came in lower than economists had expected  a shift after months of piping-hot labor market reports. The findings rekindled hopes that the Federal Reserve — which has been looking for signs that interest rates are slowing the economy — may yet cut rates before the end of the year. “This is the jobs report the Fed would have scripted ” said Seema Shah  chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. The S&P 500 rose 1.3 percent on Friday  its best day in more than two months. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies that are more sensitive to the ebb and flow of the economy also rose  up 1 percent for the day and also on course to rise for a second consecutive week. Stock investors are sensitive to rapid changes in interest rates  and the two-year Treasury yield tumbled from over 5 percent on Tuesday to 4.8 percent on Friday  a big move in a market that is typically measured in hundredths of a percentage point. Investors had started the week fearful that strong economic data and stubborn inflation would push the Fed to keep interest rates elevated for most of the year and potentially even warrant officials to move them higher. Investors had already welcomed comments on Wednesday from the Fed chair  Jerome Powell  who said it was “unlikely” the central bank would raise rates further  despite earlier intimations from some policymakers that an increase might be necessary given the strength of the U.S. economy this year. Investors now expect the Fed to cut rates at least once and potentially twice this year  with bets that the first cut will come in September  earlier than the November expectation at the start of the week. Investors’ optimism for falling rates also spurred a sell-off in the dollar  a welcome sign for countries around the world whose currencies have been pressured by unexpected dollar strength this year. Expectations that interest rates will come down tends to weigh on a currency as investors look for more lucrative places to park their money. Some investors still cautioned against reading too much into Friday’s jobs data. Jason Pride  a strategist at the asset management firm Glenmede  said investors needed to see more progress before they could expect imminent rate cuts. Another hot jobs or inflation report could be enough to keep the Fed from considering any cuts this year. “One month does not make a trend  but today’s jobs report likely gives the Fed some much-needed assurance that higher rates may be starting to do their job ” Mr. Pride said.","Business","Not related to Blockchain"

A rally in March showed how this can mask turmoil in the rest of the market.","The fate of the S&P 500 index — used by investors as a barometer for the health of corporate America  and cited by presidents as a measure of their handling of the economy — often comes down to just two companies: Apple and Microsoft. The companies that make up the S&P 500  sized by share of market value.

More than $15 trillion in assets  from pension funds and endowments to insurance companies  are linked to the performance of the S&P 500 index in some way  according to S&P Dow Jones Indices  with more than 10 cents of every dollar allocated to the broad index flowing through to Microsoft’s and Apple’s market valuation. It is a phenomenon explained by how the benchmark is constructed  and it is amplified by the way tech has come to dwarf other industries  in the markets and the economy. And it means that the two companies together can sway the direction of the broad market  sometimes masking turmoil that has taken place underneath. Trading in March offers a clear example. Even after the failures of two regional banks in the United States and the rescue of a global investment bank in Europe sent a jolt through the financial system and raised new fears about an already fragile global economy  the S&P 500 ended the month up 3.5 percent. Apple and Microsoft accounted for about half of that gain  according to data from S&P. Both were seemingly immune to the banking crisis and boosted by fervor over artificial intelligence  with Apple rising 11.4 percent during the month and Microsoft 15.6 percent.

Martínez","The Swiss lender had ended Wednesday fighting for its life, with shares at a record low and the cost to insure against a default the highest ever. The loan is an effort to avert further damage.","Credit Suisse said on Thursday that it plans to borrow as much as $54 billion from the Swiss central bank to improve its liquidity after the lender’s shares plunged to a new low. The bank will also access a “short-term liquidity facility” and will buy back about $3 billion in debt  it said in a statement released on its website. Credit Suisse  a 166-year-old institution  ended Wednesday fighting for its life. Its shares tumbled 24 percent on the SIX Swiss Exchange  hitting a new low  and the price of its bonds dropped sharply as well. The cost of financial contracts that insure against a default by the bank spiked to their highest levels on record. After European markets closed on Wednesday  the Swiss National Bank and Finma  the country’s financial regulator  issued a joint statement certifying Credit Suisse’s financial health and saying the central bank would backstop the bank if needed. Hours later  Credit Suisse said it planned to borrow 50 billion Swiss francs from the Swiss National Bank. The immediate catalyst for a perilous drop in the bank’s stock price was a comment by Ammar al-Khudairy  the chairman of the Saudi National Bank  which is the bank’s largest shareholder. In a televised interview with Bloomberg News  Mr. al-Khudairy said that the state-owned bank would not put more money into Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse has been battered by years of mistakes and controversies that have cost it two chief executives over three years. These include huge trading losses tied to the implosions of the investment firm Archegos and the lender Greensill Capital; they also include an array of scandals  from involvement in money laundering to spying on former employees. The firm has embarked on a sweeping turnaround plan  which includes thousands of layoffs and the spinoff of its Wall Street investment bank. But investors have questioned whether continuing losses and client departures — the firm lost about $147 billion worth of customer deposits in the last three months of 2022 — have endangered that effort.","Business","Not related to Blockchain"

Is Stuck  Without a Clear Lifeline - The New York Times","2023-08-11T09:01:14.000Z","By Rob Copeland","David Solomon’s management style is winning few fans amid the elite investment bank’s performance woes. He is mired in “quicksand” and unsure what to do.","One day in mid-June  Lloyd Blankfein called David Solomon  chief executive of Goldman Sachs. Mr. Solomon had not been expecting it. Mr. Blankfein  a big Goldman shareholder and Mr. Solomon’s predecessor  had lost $50 million since January on his stake because of the bank’s sinking stock. He made it clear to Mr. Solomon that his patience was waning  according to three people briefed on the conversation. Mr. Blankfein offered to provide him with more hands-on advice  or even return to the firm in any capacity that might help  the people said. Mr. Solomon  politely but firmly  turned Mr. Blankfein down. It has been a slog for Mr. Solomon. Now in his fifth year as Goldman’s leader  he is struggling to steer the elite investment bank through a humbling stretch that has brought intense focus on his management style. In July  Goldman reported a collapse in profits  the result of a misbegotten foray into consumer banking that the firm is unwinding. Goldman has undergone three rounds of layoffs over the past year. Its stock trails that of its peers. It isn’t just Mr. Blankfein who is fed up. Senior Goldman partners  former executives and investors have expressed frustration with the bank’s performance amid a turnaround plan that has yet to show results. It’s an unusual indication of unrest at a firm whose 400 or so partners have long observed an informal keep-it-in-the-family rule. Goldman’s troubles have also raised questions about the future of Mr. Solomon’s leadership  according to current and former executives involved in deliberations about the firm’s future. Even his own friends lament that his side gig as an amateur DJ has become a needless distraction. Mr. Solomon has also attracted criticism for jet-setting trips  including to private resorts owned by a company in which he has personally invested.

The investment bank  which has spent much of this year unwinding mistakes of years past  reported a profit half as large as that of its rival Morgan Stanley  to say nothing of larger lenders. At Goldman  the pain was distributed across the board  in its investment bank  sputtering consumer arm  slowing trading operations and commercial real estate portfolio. David Solomon  the bank’s chief executive  called it “obviously a tough quarter.” Perhaps in an indication of how low analyst projections had been  shares rose nearly 1 percent on Wednesday. Image The Goldman Sachs headquarters in New York. The bank reported a steep fall in profit in its latest quarter.Credit...Gabby Jones for The New York Times The Numbers Goldman Sachs reported a profit of $1.1 billion in the second quarter  down more than 60 percent from a year earlier. The bank highlighted write-downs in the value of its commercial real estate portfolio  a $1.2 billion hit to profit  and the buy-now-pay-later firm GreenSky  which subtracted nearly $700 million from its earnings. Goldman acquired GreenSky less than two years ago  as part of an ill-fated foray into consumer lending. Quarterly revenue  at $10.9 billion  was 8 percent lower than it was a year earlier. The bank employed 44 600 people at the end of June  down 2 400 from a year earlier. Goldman has gone through at least three rounds of layoffs this year  taking head count down 8 percent so far this year. Takeaways This seems to have been a rip-the-Band-Aid-off quarter for Goldman. The real estate write-down  in particular  appeared to pack potential losses into the period. There are  however  good reasons for the move. Remote or hybrid work appears here to stay  and that has bleak implications for office space and landlords in many cities. Having already conceded some losses in that area  Goldman can now shift attention to other areas of the business like investment banking  which tends to ebb and flow. “It definitely feels better over the course of the last six to eight weeks than it felt earlier in the year ” Mr. Solomon said. Context The big question for Mr. Solomon is whether he can convince investors — and many inside his own firm — of a return to the much-feared Goldman of yore. The bank is nearly a year into an extended apologia for its consumer woes  which at one point included Marcus  a consumer division named after the company’s founder  credit-card offerings and savings accounts aimed at the mass market. The bank said this year that it had lost more than $3 billion tied to those efforts since December 2020. The bank is still unwinding most of the business  at a loss  and it may expect more ugly headlines until that is finished. What’s Next Unlike more diversified lenders like JPMorgan Chase  Goldman relies heavily on its Wall Street franchise  and corporate activity has been muted in the face of economic uncertainty  rising interest rates and the like. That means that if there is a prolonged chill in deal-making  there may be little that the bank can do to fully insulate itself.","Business","Not related to Blockchain"

The bank made $14.5 billion in profit last quarter.Credit...Haruka Sakaguchi for The New York Times Why It Matters Given its size  JPMorgan in particular is a proxy for the banking industry. Jamie Dimon  the bank’s chief executive  has deep political connections  and his prognostications on the economy are scrutinized in some circles as closely as a central banker’s musings. On Friday  Mr. Dimon told analysts that he expected the U.S. economy to experience “a soft landing  mild recession or a hard recession ” though he didn’t put a time frame on the prediction. “Obviously  we shall hope for the best ” he said. In its latest report  the bank listed a litany of risks  including that consumers are burning through their cash buffers and that inflation remains high. Last quarter  JPMorgan lost $900 million on investments in U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities  which have dropped in value as rates have risen — but that was barely a dent in its results.

The thief demanded his iPhone and passcode. Mr. Oriach turned them over and fled. The next morning  Mr. Oriach  who lives in Brooklyn  said he discovered that the thief had drained $8 294 from his bank accounts at Capital One  using multiple money transfer apps including Zelle. He contacted Capital One  fully expecting the bank to refund him the stolen cash  as required by federal law. The bank refunded only $250  saying it found no evidence that the rest of the money was stolen. Mr. Oriach was stunned. “I filed a police report  identified the suspect at a precinct and even testified at a grand jury ” he said. “But none of that seems to have helped my case.” After The New York Times asked Capital One about Mr. Oriach’s case  bank representatives said they had determined there was fraud and would repay him. “We reached out to the customer to apologize for any additional stress this matter has caused ” Capital One said in an emailed statement. In recent years  payment apps like Zelle  Venmo and Cash App have become the preferred way for millions of customers to transfer money from one person to another. Last year  people sent $490 billion on Zelle  the country’s most popular payments app  and $230 billion through Venmo  its closest rival. But the same reasons that have drawn customers to these apps — they are free  fast and convenient — have made them easy targets for scammers and thieves. While banks argue that they shouldn’t have to refund customers who inadvertently granted a scammer permission to use their accounts  they have also often been reluctant to refund customers like Mr. Oriach whose money was stolen.

He was no ordinary patient  and even then — before Covid had its name — he feared that this was no ordinary ailment. Dr. Li was widely regarded in China as a heroic truth-teller. He had been punished by the authorities for trying to warn others about the virus  and then  in a terrible turn  had become severely sickened by it. Weeks later  he would become China’s most famous fatality of the emerging pandemic. He was 34. His death set off an outpouring of grief and anger on a scale and intensity rarely seen in China.

His profile on the Chinese social media site  Weibo  regularly receives hundreds of comments a week  and has become a place where people pay tribute and share their personal stories.

Many people began to leave, fearing that Israel was moving ahead with its long-planned invasion of Rafah, despite stiff international pressure. The Israeli military began dropping leaflets in eastern Rafah telling people to move to what it called a humanitarian zone to the north, and said it would also notify people by text messages, phone calls and broadcasts in Arabic, and on Monday night, the Israeli military carried out another round of what it called “targeted strikes” in Rafah against Hamas.

A military spokesman would not say when troops might enter the crowded city, but described the evacuation as part of Israel’s plans to dismantle Hamas and to free hostages taken on Oct. 7. Hours after the evacuation order, the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, issued a statement that the group had accepted a new cease-fire proposal from Qatar and Egypt, which have acted as intermediaries in peace talks. The group and Israeli officials said it was not referring to the proposal that Israel recently agreed to, leaving the conflict unresolved.

Adams and Frances Robles","More than half a dozen nations have pledged personnel to a multinational effort to stabilize Haiti, where gangs have taken over much of the capital, setting off a major humanitarian crisis.","U.S. military planes filled with civilian contractors and supplies have begun landing in Haiti, paving the way for a seven-nation security mission, led by Kenya, to deploy to the troubled Caribbean nation in the coming weeks, American officials say. But even as the security situation worsens and millions of Haitians go hungry, a military-style deployment that is estimated to cost $600 million has just a fraction of the funding required. Biden administration officials would not say whether a precise date for the deployment date had been set. The Kenyan government did not respond to requests for comment. Several military flights, including at least seven from Charleston Air Force Base in South Carolina, have landed at Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince, the capital, in the past week, according to the U.S. Southern Command. Contractors were being flown in to help secure the airport before building a base of operations there for the international security force. More planes carrying construction contractors and equipment were expected in the coming days. “The deployment of the multinational security support mission in Haiti is urgent, and we’re doing all we can to advance that goal,” Brian A. Nichols, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, told reporters last week. “Every day that goes by is a lost opportunity to provide greater security for the Haitian people.

Gangs have shut down the airport; looted seaports, public buildings and shops; and attacked nearly a dozen police stations. Roads are blocked, cutting off the food supply, and 4,600 inmates were freed after prisons were attacked. The prime minister, Ariel Henry, is stranded in Puerto Rico while gang members wreak havoc, demand his resignation and hold up dozens of trucks filled with World Food Program food shipments. A state of emergency around Port-au-Prince, the capital, was extended another month. With the government on the verge of collapse, the United States and Caribbean nations are working to come up with a resolution — including a plan for a transitional government — that would restore some semblance of order to the troubled nation and allow Mr. Henry to return home. Who are the gangs and what do they want? Experts estimate that up to 200 gangs operate in Haiti, about 20 of them in Port-au-Prince. They range from small groups of a few dozen young men who share pistols to crews of roughly 1,500 men with weekly salaries and automatic weapons who belong to hierarchal organizations with bosses. Two main gang federations, G-Pèp and the G-9 Family, control many of the poorest neighborhoods in the capital. The criminal groups and their allies sometimes collude, but more often clash.

A heat wave has scorched Mexico in recent days, bringing temperatures in multiple states into the triple digits. Mexico City on Tuesday reached a high of 92 degrees Fahrenheit, the hottest temperature recorded there on May 7 in over 20 years. Mexico’s energy authority, Cenace, announced a state of emergency for the national grid early Tuesday evening, meaning that available power had dropped below adequate levels. It said less than an hour later that the system had returned to normal. But local news media outlets reported on blackouts in municipalities across the country throughout the evening. Social media users uploaded photos and videos of darkened city skylines. Local officials confirmed several blackouts in the state of Mexico, including in San Mateo Atenco and Metepec, near Mexico City. And during a blackout in the city of Nuevo Laredo, near the Texas border, they asked people to avoid driving. In a statement, the national energy agency attributed the electricity shortage on Tuesday afternoon to a series of factors, including a drop in wind and solar power generation. Some power plants were also offline at the time, it said. The statement did not mention the heat wave. An increase in nighttime demand later required rolling power interruptions across Mexico, the agency said. Electricity was gradually being restored starting at about 8 p.m., in a process that was expected to last until 11 p.m. Mexico has experienced blackouts before, including during extreme weather events, such as hurricanes or heat waves. During power failures in the country last June, local officials reported hundreds of heat-related deaths even as federal and state governments underplayed them.","World","Not related to Blockchain"

Powerful new technologies present a more urgent risk.","There are two distinct factions of parents on TikTok: those who will crack eggs over their kids’ heads for likes and those who are trying desperately to make sure the internet doesn’t know who their children are. Listen to This Article For the 35-year-old TikTok star who posts under the name Kodye Elyse, an uncomfortable online experience made her stop including her three children on her social media. A video she posted in 2020 of her young daughter dancing attracted millions of views and creepy comments from strange men. (She requested that The New York Times not print her full name because she and her children have been doxxed in the past.) “It’s kind of like ‘The Truman Show’ on the internet,” said Kodye Elyse, who has four million followers on TikTok and posts about her work as a cosmetic tattoo artist and her experiences as a single mother. “You never know who’s looking.” After that experience, she scrubbed her children’s images from the internet. She tracked down all of her online accounts, on sites such as Facebook and Pinterest, and deleted them or made them private. She has since joined the clamorous camp of TikTokers encouraging fellow parents not to post about their children publicly. But in September, she discovered her efforts hadn’t been entirely successful. Kodye Elyse used PimEyes, a startling search engine that finds photos of a person on the internet within seconds using facial recognition technology. When she uploaded a photo of her 7-year-old son, the results included an image of him she had never seen before. She needed a $29.99 subscription to see where the image had come from.

The speculation has arisen because the fund, the $59 billion Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust — more commonly known as BREIT — has managed to keep an “appraised” value of its assets that far exceeds virtually every other real estate fund. Many rivals have fallen in value, some quite dramatically, in the face of high interest rates and a flagging property market. BREIT’s performance has floated above its competition, and it has boasted a 10.5 percent annual return since its 2017 debut. The debate over the fund’s impressive performance has taken on greater significance, and the criticism has grown louder, because of how Blackstone determines the appraised value of its assets, DealBook’s Andrew Ross Sorkin and Michael de la Merced report. Many major firms rely on a third-party appraiser to determine the worth of a fund’s assets, in part so investors can trust that the appraised value is accurate and not unduly influenced by the firms. (Those appraisals help to determine a firm’s management fees: The higher the appraisal value, the higher the fees.) Blackstone appears to do it differently. While it uses a third-party appraiser and an outside auditor, the firm has the final say on the appraised value of its own assets. Blackstone is open about its approach. From a recent prospectus: “These assumptions are determined by the Adviser, and reviewed by our independent valuation advisor.” While Blackstone discloses how it determines the final valuation, some on Wall Street have questioned how much latitude firms should have in appraising their own assets.

A spokesman for Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, said prosecutors planned to drop their case against Mr. Cenat and two other men, Denzel Dennis and Muktar Din, in exchange for the apology and $57,000 in restitution. Mr. Cenat paid $55,000 of the restitution total, which went to the Union Square Partnership to cover landscaping and other costs, the district attorney’s office said. Mr. Dennis and Mr. Din paid the balance. Mr. Cenat posted the apology on his Snapchat account on Tuesday, and Mr. Bragg’s spokeswoman, M’Niyah Lynn, said the prosecution would be dropped once the apology had been online for 24 hours. Mr. Dennis and Mr. Din were expected to post the apology as well. Mr. Cenat, noting that he is from New York, wrote in the apology that what began as a promotional event had quickly turned into “an unsafe situation for the people who live and work in the neighborhood, first responders and my followers that attended the event.” “It was never my intent for it to get so out of hand,” he added, “and I have learned a very valuable lesson that social media is a very powerful tool to do good, but it can also cause dangerous, unwanted situations if it is not used properly.” The Union Square episode, which began shortly after 3 p.m. on Aug. 4 and lasted several hours, resulted in 65 arrests (nearly half of them of underage youths); injuries to police officers and some of those in the crowd; and damage to food carts, police vehicles and stores, officials said. The events began when Mr. Cenat, who has millions of followers on Twitch and other social media platforms, summoned his fans to the area, where he said he would give away video game consoles. The gathering lacked a city permit, and the police learned of it from a social media post only hours before the crowd began swelling, officials said at the time. Hordes of young people were soon packing Union Square Park and spilling onto the surrounding streets and sidewalks and blocking cars and pedestrians. The Union Square Greenmarket shut down early, and subway trains began bypassing the Union Square station. Within an hour, the Police Department had initiated a Level 4 mobilization, its highest-level response. Some in the crowd were peaceful, but others were not. One cluster of people stormed a construction site. Building materials, rocks, bottles, basketballs, a computer and fireworks sailed through the crowd. “I believe he saw that day how much influence he really has,” Jeffrey Maddrey, the Police Department’s chief of department, said of Mr. Cenat afterward.","New York","Not related to Blockchain"

Trump’s criminal case has threatened him with jail if he continues violating the terms of a gag order.","A day after the judge presiding over Donald J. Trump’s trial said he would consider jailing the former president should he continue to violate court orders, Mayor Eric Adams said the city’s lockups stand ready. “Our amazing commissioner, she is prepared for whatever comes on Rikers Island,” said the mayor at an unrelated news conference, apparently referring to Lynelle Maginley-Liddie, the commissioner of the Department of Correction. “I’m pretty sure she would be prepared to manage and deal with the situation.” Justice Juan M. Merchan, the judge presiding over Mr. Trump’s criminal trial in Lower Manhattan, on Monday warned the former president that should he continue to defy a gag order, he might end up on Rikers, because fines “are not serving as a deterrent.” “Going forward, this court will have to consider jail,” Justice Merchan said. The judge has prohibited the former president from making attacks on witnesses, jurors and court staff, an order Mr. Trump has repeatedly violated. The prospect of Mr. Trump ending up on Rikers Island, New York City’s main jail and a notoriously violent, dilapidated facility, has already been the topic of discussion among federal, state and local officials. The New York Times reported in April that the possibility poses unprecedented logistical challenges for the U.S. Secret Service, which would have to protect Mr. Trump within Rikers Island by screening his food, separating him from other inmates and rotating officers into the jail on regular shifts. If Mr. Trump does end up on Rikers Island, he would be in prominent company. His longtime financial lieutenant, Allen H. Weisselberg, is serving a five-month sentence on Rikers for perjury. Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced movie mogul, is being sent back there, according to The City. The nonprofit publication found that he had been enjoying “V.I.P. treatment” in a private room at Bellevue Hospital after his 2020 conviction on felony sex crimes was recently overturned. (A 2022 conviction in California on rape charges still stands.) On Tuesday, Mr. Adams expressed no concerns about the challenges Mr. Trump’s imprisonment might pose for Rikers Island. “They’re professionals,” he said. “They’ll be ready.”","New York","Not related to Blockchain"

Trump met Stormy Daniels, their flirtation seemed fleeting: He was a 60-year-old married mogul at the peak of reality television fame, and she was 27, a Louisiana native raised in poverty and headed to porn-film stardom. But that chance encounter in Lake Tahoe, Nev., some two decades ago is now at the center of the first criminal trial of an American president, an unprecedented case that could shape the 2024 presidential race. This week, Ms. Daniels has been on the witness stand telling her side of the story, often in explicit detail. She has already faced five hours of questioning, and after the trial’s midweek hiatus, she is expected to return on Thursday to undergo additional cross-examination from Mr. Trump’s legal team. The charges against Mr. Trump stem from her story of sex with him during that 2006 celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, a story she was shopping a decade later, in the closing days of the presidential campaign. Mr. Trump’s longtime lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 in hush money before Election Day, and the former president is accused of falsifying business records to cover up reimbursements for Mr. Cohen. The Links Between Trump and 3 Hush-Money Deals Here’s how key figures involved in making hush-money payoffs on behalf of Donald J. Trump are connected. On Tuesday, Ms. Daniels’s fast-paced testimony lasted nearly five hours, during which she described an encounter with Mr. Trump, now 77, that he has long denied.

Trump and the ensuing hush-money cover-up that has become the bedrock of the prosecution’s case. Ms. Daniels spoke quickly and at length about her first meeting with Mr. Trump at a celebrity golf tournament near Lake Tahoe in Nevada. After the lunch break, Mr. Trump’s lawyer Todd Blanche moved for a mistrial, arguing that the prosecution’s questions had been designed to embarrass Mr. Trump and prejudice the jury. The judge, Juan M. Merchan, agreed that some of Ms. Daniels’s testimony might have “been better left unsaid,” but he denied a mistrial. The former president is accused of falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 payment to Ms. Daniels just before the 2016 election. Mr. Trump, 77, has denied the charges and says he did not have sex with Ms. Daniels. If convicted, he could face prison time or probation. Here are six takeaways from Mr. Trump’s 13th day on trial. Prosecutors took a risk with their witness. Jurors heard a vivid account of the Lake Tahoe encounter and met the woman who received the hush-money deal. This could present a risk for prosecutors, depending on whether the jury viewed Ms. Daniels’s story as prurient or powerful.

That inquiry reflects the evolving calculations of Mr. Trump’s vice-presidential search — and how his scramble to keep up with President Biden’s colossal fund-raising totals may be weighing on his mind as he considers his options. Mr. Trump’s selection process, which is still in its early stages, has largely revolved around conventional questions like who could step in as president if needed, political calculations including contenders’ position on abortion rights, and more Trumpian curiosities like whether a politician physically resembles his idea of a vice president. But Mr. Trump has asked several people about the fund-raising prowess of possible running mates, according to three people with direct knowledge of the conversations, signaling a fresh angle in his search for a running mate. The initial feedback has pointed him toward a handful of members of Congress with strong donor connections and at least one deep-pocketed governor. One long-shot possibility with a proven record of raising piles of cash — former Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina — was only recently a bitter presidential rival, and her name can spark outrage from Mr. Trump. “Trump is going to want a team player, and this is going to be about adding value to the ticket,” said former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who remains close with Mr. Trump and set records for Republican fund-raising. “It’s also going to be about someone who understands the job — who understands the Senate and the House — because he’s not going to want to waste one minute in office.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

But the government has not given up the fight with the tech industry. Open Whisper Systems, a maker of a widely used encryption app called Signal, received a subpoena in the first half of the year for subscriber information and other details associated with two phone numbers that came up in a federal grand jury investigation in Virginia. The subpoena arrived with a court order that said Open Whisper Systems was not allowed to tell anyone about the information request for one year. Technology companies contend that court-imposed gag orders are being used too often by law enforcement and that they violate the Bill of Rights. The companies also complain that law enforcement officials are casting a wide net over online communications — often too wide — in their investigations. Justice Department officials, for their part, argue that these gag orders are necessary to protect developing cases and to avoid tipping off potential targets. The officials say that they are simply following leads where they take them. Through a spokesman, the Justice Department declined to comment on the case. The information request made of Open Whisper Systems is particularly sensitive, since its encryption app is used around the world, and it is often recommended to journalists and human rights activists.

Hours earlier, Israeli tanks and troops entered the southern Gaza city of Rafah and seized control of the border crossing with Egypt, halting the flow of aid into the enclave. U.N. officials warned that the humanitarian crisis in the besieged territory would worsen. Here’s the latest. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister who is under pressure from the U.S. and other allies to agree to a truce, said that while he had sent negotiators back to the talks, “in tandem, we continue waging the war on Hamas.” Analysts said that Israel’s incursion into Rafah could either ratchet up the pressure on Hamas to make a deal or sabotage the talks. But the move did not appear to be the full ground invasion of Rafah that Israel had long been threatening and that its allies had been working to avert, and the Israeli military called the move “a very precise” counterterrorism operation. Devastating consequences: The head of a hospital in Rafah said that 27 bodies and 150 wounded people had been brought to his facility since the start of the incursion. The Israeli military said it had killed about 20 people in Rafah, describing the dead as Hamas militants. Analysis: Netanyahu, under pressure from all sides, is trying to reassure his many domestic, military and diplomatic critics. Here’s a look at what he is confronting. In other news from the war: International officials condemned the incursion. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry called Israel’s seizure of the Rafah border crossing a “dangerous escalation,” while Josep Borrell Fontelles, the top E.U. diplomat, said that he feared it would cause “a lot of casualties.” President Biden paused an arms shipment to Israel last week to prevent the U.S.-made weapons from being used in an assault on Rafah, administration officials said last night.

In Melbourne, some of their descendants are leading the way to preserve the Yiddish language.","“Mir kumen on, mir kumen on! Un fest un zikher undzer trot!” Late on a recent Friday night, dozens of voices joined in this Yiddish anthem — “We are coming, we are coming! And our step is firm and true!” — and soared from a conference center among gum trees and kookaburras outside Melbourne, Australia. Today, Yiddish is most commonly used in ultra-Orthodox communities in places like Brooklyn or Jerusalem. But in Melbourne, snatches of it can be heard on certain streets, around multigenerational dinner tables, on stages and in classrooms. And one weekend a year, Australian speakers of Yiddish come together at Sof-Vokh Oystralye, or Weekend Australia, for 48 hours of total immersion in the language of a thousand years of Jewish life and culture that, before the Holocaust, was spoken by 13 million people, mostly in Eastern Europe. For some of the singers at this year’s retreat, in late May, Yiddish is the hard-fought language of everyday life. For others, it evokes a long-ago childhood in an immigrant neighborhood in Melbourne. For many of the tiniest participants, including some who had already been dispatched to bed, it is the language of the classroom, sitting easily alongside Hebrew and English at the world’s only secular primary school where it is a compulsory daily subject. Image Zelda bakery in Melbourne sells kosher breads and pastries.Credit...Christina Simons for The New York Times At Sof-Vokh, attendees in beanies and scarves emblazoned with the insignia of Australian football teams played Dungeons and Dragons, basketball and chess; smeared creamy cheese into blintzes in a stainless steel-wrapped catering kitchen; and played games in which they impersonated animals and translated gibberish into poetry — all in Yiddish.

Conocido por los pueblos aborígenes del desierto occidental de Australia como kakarratul, no tiene ojos y su pelaje es desgreñado y dorado. Con solo 10 centímetros de nariz a cola, el animal cabe en la palma de la mano. Y, a diferencia de los topos de Norteamérica, es un marsupial. Pero probablemente no verías ninguno: aunque los animales son abundantes, los avistamientos siguen siendo muy raros porque los topos marsupiales del norte viven en túneles bajo las dunas de arena, y navegan con un movimiento similar al de la natación utilizando unas patas delanteras parecidas a aletas. “Es el animal más difícil de encontrar”, afirmó Denzel Hunter, guarda forestal indígena que trabaja en la vigilancia y conservación de la fauna salvaje en las tierras del pueblo Nyangumarta. “Cada vez que salimos a buscar topos marsupiales del norte, encontramos pruebas de que están ahí. Pero yo nunca he visto ninguno”. A principios de este mes, los guardabosques Kanyirninpa Jukurrpa Martu encontraron un kakarratul en el Gran Desierto Arenoso, a casi 1609 kilómetros al noreste de Perth. Las fotografías de la criatura, que solo había sido vista un puñado de veces en la última década, amplían el conocimiento científico de la especie y de las regiones desérticas, que constituyen casi un tercio de la superficie de Australia. El hallazgo también pone en relieve el valor de los 60 grupos de guardas forestales del desierto que supervisan gran parte del sistema nacional de zonas protegidas de Australia.

Known to the First Nations peoples in the Western Desert of Australia as the kakarratul, it is eyeless and has shaggy golden fur. Just four inches from nose to tail, the animal would fit in the palm of your hand. And unlike the mole species of North America, it is a marsupial. But you probably wouldn’t see one: While the animals are plentiful, sightings remain extremely rare because northern marsupial moles live in tunnels beneath sand dunes, navigating them with a swimming-like motion using flipper-like front feet. “This is the hardest of all the animals to find,” said Denzel Hunter, an Indigenous ranger who works to survey and conserve wildlife in the lands of the Nyangumarta people. “Every time we go out looking for northern marsupial moles, we find evidence that they’re there. But I’ve never seen one.” Earlier this month, Kanyirninpa Jukurrpa Martu rangers found a kakarratul in the Great Sandy Desert, nearly 1,000 miles northeast of Perth. Their photographs of the creature, which has been spotted only a handful of times in the past decade, expand scientific knowledge of the species as well as of the wider desert regions that make up close to one-third of Australia’s land mass. The find also highlights the value of the 60 desert ranger groups that oversee much of Australia’s national system of protected areas. “It’s once you start digging into the detail of that country with the people who know it best that you really start to get an appreciation of the place,” said Gareth Catt, who as program manager of the Indigenous Desert Alliance has worked extensively with ranger programs. “It’s the Indigenous rangers that have that enduring connection and are best placed to understand and look after that country.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Wind farms in Minnesota and North Dakota have been abruptly canceled. And programs to encourage Massachusetts and Maine residents to adopt solar power are faltering. The energy transition poised for takeoff in the United States amid record investment in wind, solar and other low-carbon technologies is facing a serious obstacle: The volume of projects has overwhelmed the nation’s antiquated systems to connect new sources of electricity to homes and businesses. So many projects are trying to squeeze through the approval process that delays can drag on for years, leaving some developers to throw up their hands and walk away. More than 8,100 energy projects — the vast majority of them wind, solar and batteries — were waiting for permission to connect to electric grids at the end of 2021, up from 5,600 the year before, jamming the system known as interconnection. That’s the process by which electricity generated by wind turbines or solar arrays is added to the grid — the network of power lines and transformers that moves electricity from the spot where it is created to cities and factories. There is no single grid; the United States has dozens of electric networks, each overseen by a different authority. PJM Interconnection, which operates the nation’s largest regional grid, stretching from Illinois to New Jersey, has been so inundated by connection requests that last year it announced a freeze on new applications until 2026, so that it can work through a backlog of thousands of proposals, mostly for renewable energy.

Chargers Are Coming - The New York Times","2024-05-07T19:01:27.000Z","By Manuela Andreoni","Experts say that a new wave of electric vehicle charging stations are coming soon, even after Tesla gutted its charger team.","Last week, Tesla laid off most of its electric car charging team, raising doubts about the feasibility of the Biden administration’s ambitious E.V. expansion plans. Though Tesla accounts for more than half of the fast E.V. chargers currently installed in the United States, and though it has continued to build them faster and cheaper than anyone else, the E.V. charging market may no longer need Tesla to lead it. In fact, experts I spoke to believe the E.V. charging industry is set to expand quickly over the next few years. Let me explain why. At first, Tesla’s move seemed like a blow to a sector that may seem like it’s struggling to grow despite the $7.5 billion investment from the bipartisan infrastructure law passed by President Biden in 2021. The administration’s goal is to build a network of a half million fast and slow chargers in the country by 2030, more than double what the U.S. has today. But roughly two and a half years after the bill’s passage only eight federally funded charging stations have opened in six states, according to government data. Elon Musk, Tesla’s C.E.O., hasn’t explained why he decided to cut back on charger construction, but some analysts interviewed by my colleagues Jack Ewing and Ivan Penn said he had probably concluded that it would become harder to make money from charging as more companies entered the market. As Ewing and Penn wrote, last year all major automakers selling cars in North America agreed to use the charging plug developed by Tesla, which has a reputation for being reliable and easy-to-use.

The layoffs of about 500 Tesla employees, which many of them posted about on social media on Tuesday, raised questions about deals that Mr. Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, struck with the leaders of General Motors, Ford Motor and other automakers last year allowing cars made by other companies to use Tesla Supercharger stations. Tesla’s agreements with other makers of electric cars assured buyers that they would be able to find fast chargers on road trips, addressing one of the main reasons that many people are hesitant to buy such cars. It was also seen as a coup for Mr. Musk, validating Tesla’s technology and giving the company outsize influence over the auto industry. Almost all major manufacturers announced plans to switch the hardware and software in their cars to make them compatible with Tesla’s chargers. Ford has been mailing adapters to owners of its older electric vehicles so they can connect to Tesla’s chargers. Mr. Musk said on X, the social media site he owns, that Tesla would slow down construction of new charging stations and increase its “focus on 100% uptime and expansion of existing locations.” On Monday, in an email to employees that was reviewed by The New York Times, Mr. Musk said he would dissolve the “entire group of approximately 500 people” that had worked on building new Supercharger stations. In that message, he said the company would finish stations under construction and build some new ones “where critical.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Toymakers Want to Hear From You. - The New York Times","2024-05-04T09:00:14.000Z","By Isaac Aronow","Companies like Lego and Mattel have divisions that seek out design concepts directly from collectors and other highly dedicated fan bases.","Near the end of 2022, Lucas Bolt, an environmental artist and Lego enthusiast in Amsterdam, was working on a design for a Lego set the company had crowdsourced to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Dungeons & Dragons, the tabletop role-playing game. “I spent two very intense weeks working on it, every night, every weekend, all the time that I had,” he said. Mr. Bolt was hoping to create the design for Lego Ideas, a program the toymaker started in 2008 to solicit ideas online directly from fans. Typically, designers post their concept on the platform, and if a design gets 10,000 votes, the company considers it for production. This case was different, though: It was the first time the company had given fans a concept to work with. Mr. Bolt had been designing his own sets for a few years, primarily for his followers on Instagram, but this was the first time something he had produced had gained real traction. A panel of judges selected his set and four others for a shortlist, and in a vote fans chose his set as their favorite. Lego Ideas is part of a growing strategy among companies that are creating divisions devoted to going directly to consumers for ideas. Lego takes a more personal approach, allowing fans to submit designs, while other companies poll consumers about what they would like to see or speak to inventors about their latest projects. These initiatives are finding particular success within niche groups of collectors and other highly dedicated fans. Toy companies that have direct-to-consumer models do not have the same audience reach that distributors like Amazon have, but a unit devoted to direct sales still provides advantages for the overall business, said Jaime M. Katz, an analyst who covers the toy industry for Morningstar, a financial services company. The primary reason companies like direct sales is the speed at which they are able to get access to purchasing data from consumers. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

The New Yorker posted a roughly nine-minute video titled “Professional Scrabble Players Replay Their Greatest Moves,” and I, not even knowing that one could be a “professional Scrabble player,” clicked immediately. In that video, some of the game’s greatest players showed off moves that were impressive and exciting, even without their full contexts. I had a little bit of experience with the game, but after watching the video I was totally hooked, and wanted to start playing the game at a high level. The idea of being someone who could decipher an obscure anagram from a handful of randomly selected letters appealed to me. The competitive element further boosted my interest. Armed with The New Yorker video and a lot of hubris, I took to an online crossword game server and was beaten so badly I wasn’t sure I wanted to ever play again. I lost by over 150 points, an absolutely brutal defeat. “But,” I thought, “you have to be bad at something before you get good at it,” so I queued up for another game, and was promptly routed by a different player, this time by an even greater margin. I like words a lot. I was never a “read the dictionary for fun” person, but I do love a good instruction manual. A big part of my job is making sure words are being used properly, by the book, and part of that means knowing the difference between a podium and a lectern (a podium is a flat, raised platform; a lectern is a stand for holding notes). The most striking thing I learned as I kept playing (and losing) online, though, was the value of two-letter words. Scrabble is a crossword game, and I had been thinking about it in the sense of long, marquee answers. In reality, being able to play small and make space for those big answers is just as valuable, if not more valuable, than being able to deftly figure out anagrams. Preventing your opponent from making a high-scoring play is valuable if you’re ahead, especially if extending your lead means opening up scoring opportunities for them. For top-level competitive Scrabble players, where you place a word on the board matters a lot more than the word itself. Many top players don’t know the meanings of many common Scrabble words (the game’s rules don’t require them to), and the game becomes far more about strategy than anything else.

Minced oaths are euphemistically rendered expressions of profanity or obscenity that gained popularity among playwrights of the Elizabethan era. Bowdlerization began a few hundred years later, when a well-meaning couple sought to make Shakespeare more family-friendly. And today, the teens use algospeak to avoid censors on TikTok, often using emojis in place of words. While I cannot confirm that Michael Schlossberg constructed today’s crossword with any of those strategies in mind, I can tell you that solving his puzzle will give you a particularly creative way to express your delight about what lies inside the grid. Today’s Theme I can honestly say that I let out a “Little laugh” (53D) when I entered the revealer of Mr. Schlossberg’s puzzle (though mine sounded a little more like a “hehe” than a TEHEE). “What you might cry upon recognizing this puzzle’s ingredient list?” (62A) requires first solving the entries with gray-shaded squares: 17A, 20A, 32A, 42A and 54A. These yield a recipe of MILKSOP, COCOA BEACH, BUTTERFINGERS, SUGAR SNAP PEAS and VANILLA ICE. When mixed together, the terms in bold elicit a delicious confection that doubles as an interjection — OH, FUDGE! We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

But I can assure you that its creator, Justin Werfel, and Ms. Handa didn’t arrange for their grids to appear on consecutive days. As Christina Iverson, a puzzle editor for The New York Times, has explained in the Easy Mode newsletter — which I recommend to any beginners looking to improve their solving skills — eerie coincidences in the Times Crossword are just that: coincidences. Mr. Werfel’s debut crossword for The Times, however, is no matter of chance: It takes creativity, diligence and attention to detail for a constructor’s puzzle to make its way to publication, and I found this one to be a winning combination of all three. I look forward to seeing more from him in the future. Today’s Theme What do a door-to-door salesman, a cathedral worker and an acclaimed experimental neurologist have in common? First, let’s identify the characters in question: Our salesman is WILLY LOMAN (16A), from a classic Arthur Miller play. QUASIMODO (35A) is the “Victor Hugo character who works at Notre Dame.” And IVAN PAVLOV (47A) was the Nobel Prize-winning scientist “who conditioned dogs to salivate.” Now, let’s consider the revealer, which asks for an expression that means “Sounds familiar” (57A). The answer is RINGS A BELL. And this is the “action associated with” the three men above: Loman rang doorbells, Quasimodo tolled the church bell and Pavlov used a bell to make dogs think it was dinnertime. Ding, ding, ding!

Bush and Bill Clinton. Credit...Marcy Nighswander/Associated Press With six months to go until the election, it’s still too early to judge whether Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Democrat-turned-independent candidate for president, will prove to be more than a mere spoiler. He starts out with roughly 10 percent of the vote and one of the most famous names in American politics. It’s enough to at least contemplate whether he’ll be the kind of third-party candidate who makes a lasting mark. Even without having won the presidency, third-party candidates have often played an important and even healthy role in American politics. They can elevate new issues, represent marginal constituencies and sometimes even win plenty of votes: Six third-party candidates have either won states or reached double digits in the national vote since the rise of the two-party system. They can be a lot more than mere spoilers. Image The most distinguishing views of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are not on the typical major issues but on vaccines. Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York Times The polling shows many of the conditions for a successful third-party candidacy could be in place. Voters dislike both candidates. They’ve been dissatisfied with the state of the country for 20 years, but for the most part the campaign season hasn’t been focused on solutions to customary longstanding problems. It’s enough to wonder whether this might be the first time since 1992 that a third-party-candidate gains a meaningful foothold. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Credit...Jane Rosenberg/Reuters Donald J. Trump appears to be a stronger candidate than he was four years ago, polling suggests, and not just because a notable number of voters look back on his presidency as a time of relative peace and prosperity. It’s also because his political liabilities, like his penchant to offend and his legal woes, don’t dominate the news the way they once did. In the last New York Times/Siena College poll, only 38 percent of voters said they’d been offended by Mr. Trump “recently,” even as more than 70 percent said they had been offended by him at some point. We didn’t ask a question like this back in 2016 or 2020 for comparison (unfortunately), but my subjective thumb-in-the-wind gauge says that, if we had, more voters would have said yes to the “recently offended” question. Mr. Trump’s most outrageous comments just don’t dominate the news cycle the way they did four to eight years ago. Similarly, many voters seem to be tuning out his myriad legal challenges. A majority of voters said they thought he had committed federal crimes, but only 27 percent of registered voters in the last Times/Siena poll said they were paying “a lot of attention” to the news about the legal cases against him. That’s much lower than the 39 percent back in October 2019 who said they were paying a lot of attention to the Trump-Ukraine controversy (the “perfect” phone call). It seems plausible that the lack of attention paid to Mr. Trump contributed to his early strength in the polling. Voters generally still don’t like him — in fact, his favorability rating is unchanged from our 2020 polling. But his liabilities just aren’t in the forefront of people’s minds, making it easier for the “double haters” — those who tell pollsters they dislike both candidates — to back him over President Biden.

Trump’s presidency have become more positive since he left office, bolstering his case for election and posing a risk to President Biden’s strategy of casting his opponent as unfit for the presidency, according to a new poll by The New York Times and Siena College. While the memories of Mr. Trump’s tumultuous and chaotic administration have not significantly faded, many voters now have a rosier picture of his handling of the economy, immigration and maintaining law and order. Ahead of the 2020 election, only 39 percent of voters said that the country was better off after Mr. Trump took office. Now, looking back, nearly half say that he improved things during his time as president. The poll’s findings underscore the way in which a segment of voters have changed their minds about the Trump era, recalling those years as a time of economic prosperity and strong national security. The shift in views about his administration comes even as Mr. Trump faces dozens of felony counts and will appear in a New York courtroom on Monday for jury selection in one of his four criminal trials. How respondents’ views of Trump have changed 30 40 50 60% From 2020 to now 2020 2024 Approve of his handling of the economy +10 Think he left the country better off +9 Approve of his handling of maintaining law & order +8 Approve of his handling of unifying America +4 Approve of his handling of Covid +3 Approve of his handling of the Supreme Court +1 From 2016 to now 2016 2024 Think electing him is a “safe” choice +11 Think he respects women –4 How respondents’ views of Trump have changed 30 40 50 60% From 2020 to now 2020 2024 Approve of his handling of the economy +10 Think he left the country better off +9 Approve of his handling of maintaining law & order +8 Approve of his handling of unifying America +4 Approve of his handling of Covid +3 Approve of his handling of the Supreme Court +1 From 2016 to now 2016 2024 Think electing him is a “safe” choice +11 Think he respects women –4 Note: Changes between surveys of three percentage points or less are not considered statistically significant. Based on CBS News/New York Times polls of registered voters conducted in the fall of 2016 and New York Times/Siena College polls conducted in the fall of 2020 and in April 2024. Many voters still remember Mr. Trump as a divisive and polarizing figure, giving him low ratings on race relations and unifying the country. Yet, a larger share of voters see Mr. Trump’s term as better for the country than the current administration, with 42 percent rating the Trump presidency as mostly good for the country compared with 25 percent who say the same about Mr. Biden’s. Nearly half say the Biden years have been mostly bad for the country. Many of Mr. Trump’s key constituencies, such as white voters without a college degree, are particularly likely to have a fond view of his time in office. But a broad swath of the country — including Hispanic voters, voters over 30 and most lower- and middle-income voters — now see Mr. Trump’s years in office as more good than bad. Do you generally remember the years that (this candidate) was president as mostly good years for America, mostly bad years for America, or not really good or bad?

Symptoms included high fever, trouble breathing and lung lesions, but Chinese health officials said there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Two days later, Chinese scientists identified the source of the new disease: a previously unidentified coronavirus. Within weeks, the pathogen was sickening scores of people in Wuhan, and China took the drastic step of locking down the city, effectively sealing off its 11 million inhabitants from the world. Then, time seemed to accelerate. Seismic events began to take place, one after the next: Professional sports leagues around the world suspended seasons. Stocks plunged. Donald Trump cut off travel from Europe. The World Health Organization declared the virus a pandemic. Soon, entire countries began shutting down. Popular tourist sites and metropolises across the world became ghost towns. By early April, authorities had told four billion people — roughly half of humanity — to stay home. “If you look at the very beginning, we found ourselves in — at least in our memory — the unprecedented situation of the evolution of what would turn out to be one of the most devastating pandemics in more than a century,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, who helped lead the U.S. government’s response to the pandemic, told me this week. “That, at first, was complicated by the opaqueness of the Chinese authorities and letting the rest of the world know what was actually going on.” In those initial days, there was so much we didn’t know — and so much speculation and misinformation — that The New York Times started a newsletter on March 2, 2020, to serve as an informed guide to the global outbreak.

After four days, he went to a hospital, and a doctor told him he had a form of viral pneumonia, without offering specifics. Mr. Li, 42, was hospitalized, then transferred to another facility and quarantined with other patients who had similarly unexplained symptoms. Mr. Li is one of 59 people in the central city of Wuhan who have been sickened by a pneumonia-like illness, the cause of which is unclear. The cases have alarmed Chinese officials, who are racing to unravel the mystery behind them in a region where the memory of an outbreak of the dangerous respiratory disease known as SARS remains fresh. SARS originated in China and killed more than 800 people worldwide in 2002 and 2003. At the time, the Chinese government tried to cover up the problem, which is exacerbating fear now about this new illness. Symptoms of the new illness include high fever, difficulty breathing and lung lesions, the Wuhan health commission has said. No deaths have been reported but seven people are critically ill. On Sunday, the city government said they had ruled out as causes SARS, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), bird flu and the adenovirus. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Delegations from Israel and Hamas also arrived in Cairo to resume talks on a proposed deal for a cease-fire. Here’s the latest. Israel’s operation did not appear to be the long-threatened full ground invasion. The Israeli military called it “a very precise” counterterrorism operation. It said it had gone into the city to destroy Hamas infrastructure used in an attack that killed four Israeli soldiers over the weekend near another border crossing, this one from Israel into Gaza. The head of a hospital in Rafah said that 27 bodies and 150 wounded people had been brought to his facility since the start of the incursion. Rafah’s so-called safe zone: The area Israel has designated as a safe zone for Gazans fleeing the city is neither safe nor equipped to receive them, U.N. and European officials said yesterday. The head of the Norwegian Refugee Council said in a statement that the area was “already overstretched and devoid of vital services.” Updates on cease-fire talks: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is under pressure from the U.S. and other allies to agree to a cease-fire, said that while he had sent a delegation back to the talks, “in tandem, we continue waging the war on Hamas.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Hours later, the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, said that the group had accepted a cease-fire proposal from Qatar and Egypt. The full details of the proposal were unclear, but the conflict remains unresolved. Comments by Hamas and Israeli officials made it clear that Haniyeh was not referring to the plan that Israel had recently put forward. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the proposal did not meet Israel’s demands. Israel’s war cabinet had also decided unanimously to “continue with its action in Rafah in order to exert military pressure on Hamas,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. Thousands of people were leaving Rafah yesterday, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society, which said that there had been “escalating Israeli airstrikes” in areas east of the city. A sense of panic coursed through the city, as prices for food and fuel skyrocketed. Context: Israel seems set to invade Rafah, despite pressure from the country’s closest allies, including the U.S., arguing that doing so would take a heavy toll on civilians. An Israeli military spokesman would not say when troops might enter the city, but described the evacuation as part of Israel’s plans to dismantle Hamas and to free hostages taken on Oct. 7.

He will also visit Serbia and Hungary. The three countries, to varying degrees, are embracing China’s push for a new global order. Xi seems intent on seizing opportunities to loosen the continent’s bonds with the U.S. and forge a world freed of its dominance. The visit is likely to be seen as a none-too-subtle effort by Xi to divide Western allies. Soon after arriving in Paris, he praised France, whose president, Emmanuel Macron, has often made the Gaullist point that Europe “must never be a vassal of the United States.” The chemistry between Xi and Macron — who visited China just over a year ago, and echoed the Chinese lexicon of a “multipolar” world, freed of “blocs” — appears to lie in a shared view that the postwar order must be replaced. Xi wants to court leaders who are frustrated by U.S. dominance, see China as a counterweight and are eager to bolster economic ties. Analysis: “Macron is trying to bring a third way in the current global chaos,” said one French expert on relations with China. What’s next: Tomorrow, Xi heads to Serbia. His arrival coincides with the 25th anniversary of the deadly NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. That mistaken strike, for which the White House apologized, killed three Chinese journalists and ignited protests around the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.

The Chinese leader has chosen three countries to visit — France, Serbia and Hungary — that all, to a greater or lesser degree, look askance at America’s postwar ordering of the world, see China as a necessary counterweight and are eager to bolster economic ties. At a time of tensions with much of Europe — over China’s “no limits” embrace of Russia despite the war in Ukraine, its surveillance state and its apparent espionage activities that led to the recent arrest in Germany of four people — Mr. Xi, who arrived in France on Sunday, wants to demonstrate China’s growing influence on the continent and pursue a pragmatic rapprochement. For Europe, the visit will test its delicate balancing act between China and the United States and will no doubt be seen in Washington as a none-too-subtle effort by Mr. Xi to divide Western allies. Chinese-French relations “have established a model for the international community of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation between countries with different social systems,” Mr. Xi said in a statement issued soon after he arrived in Paris. He has timed his arrival at his second stop, Serbia, to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the deadly NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during the Kosovo war. That mistaken strike on May 7, 1999, for which the White House apologized, killed three Chinese journalists and ignited furious protests around the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. “For Xi, being in Belgrade is a very economical way to ask if the United States is really serious about international law,” said Janka Oertel, the director of the Asia program at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, “and to say, how about NATO overreach as a problem for other countries?” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

If only the weather had cooperated.","The French president, Emmanuel Macron, who believes that a personal touch is the key to diplomacy, lured President Xi Jinping of China to a 7,000-foot pass in the Pyrenees on Tuesday, expecting to show off the sweeping views that had stamped his childhood, but instead finding dense fog and wild snow flurries. It was a long, slippery road up the mountain, under torrential rain, but that didn’t stop crowds of Chinese admirers with red flags and pennants from gathering in almost every village along the way, miraculously transposed to a remote area of southwestern France and seemingly uniform in their enthusiasm. Undeterred, but running two hours late, Mr. Macron greeted Mr. Xi under an umbrella at one of his favorite restaurants, L’Étape du Berger, or the Shepherd’s Stop, where dancers in colorful local dress twirled and jigged to the sounds of a flute, an accordion and a tom-tom. Mr. Xi was impassive, but his wife, Peng Liyuan, smiled broadly and applauded. Using the familiar “tu” form to address Mr. Xi, 70, rather than the formal “vous” that would have been more customary between heads of state, Mr. Macron, 46, offered the Chinese leader a yellow jersey signed by last year’s Tour de France winner, Jonas Vingegaard, a Danish cyclist. “I know how much you love sport,” Mr. Macron said. Mr. Xi is known for his interest in soccer. The Col du Tourmalet, where the leaders met, has mythical status in the Tour de France; its steep and winding ascent is a severe test. It is also a place dear to Mr. Macron, who regularly came here from his home in northern France to stay at the nearby house of his maternal grandmother, Germaine Nogues, the member of his family about whom he speaks most effusively.

Mr. Macron and Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission’s president, who attended a morning session of talks, pressured Mr. Xi to use his influence on Moscow to bring the war to an end. Mr. Xi will host President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Beijing later this month, but there was no suggestion — other than a general wish for peace — that he would ask his “no limits” ally to stop the war.

The front line is a place of ghastly violence where hundreds of thousands of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers have been killed or wounded, according to conservative Western estimates. The list of Ukrainian cities and towns largely razed to the ground by Russian bombs and artillery grows with each passing month. Russian forces have moved forward in small increments, suffering a staggering number of casualties to take cities like Avdiivka, which Moscow captured in February. Away from the front, millions of Ukrainians have spent hours in bomb shelters as Russia continues to rain down missiles and drones on military units and civilians across the nation. Ukraine’s energy grid is severely damaged — working but sporadic. Thousands of schools, hospitals and cultural institutions have been damaged or destroyed. Millions have lost their homes. For all that time, photographers with The New York Times and other news organizations have chronicled the war, capturing a slice of how soldiers and civilians have experienced it.

They said the plot also targeted top Ukrainian intelligence officials.","Ukraine’s security services said on Tuesday that they had foiled a Russian plot to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky and other top military and political figures. Two Ukrainian colonels accused of participating in the plot have been arrested on suspicion of treason. The Ukrainian domestic intelligence agency, the S.B.U., said in a statement that the plot had involved a network of agents — including the two colonels — that was run by Russia’s Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the main successor to the K.G.B. According to the S.B.U., the agents working at Russia’s direction were tasked with identifying people close to Mr. Zelensky’s security detail who could take him hostage and later kill him. The agency’s statement said the other top Ukrainian officials targeted in the plot included Vasyl Malyuk, the head of the S.B.U., and Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency. The Ukrainian claims could not be independently verified. It is not the first time that Ukraine has reported a potential assassination attempt aimed at its top leaders. Mr. Zelensky said in an interview with an Italian television channel earlier this year that his security services had told him of more than 10 such efforts. Ukraine’s security services offered few details about previous assassination plots. But this time, the agency went to some length in its statement to describe how the Ukrainian officials were to be killed. The services said the two colonels accused in the plot belonged to the State Security Administration, which protects top officials. They had been recruited before the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, according to the statement, which identified three F.S.B. members — Maxim Mishustin, Dmytro Perlin and Oleksiy Kornev — as running the operation from Moscow. The two Ukrainian colonels were not named. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Putin will take center stage this week at two major events that will showcase his dominance over the country’s politics and his determination to win in Ukraine. On Tuesday, Mr. Putin, 71, formally began his fifth term as Russia’s president in a highly choreographed inauguration ceremony in the Kremlin. On Thursday, he is to preside over the Victory Day parade in Red Square, an annual demonstration of military might that in the last two years sought to symbolically link Russia’s war in Ukraine with the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. The Kremlin is also expected to nominate a prime minister and five key ministers, including foreign and defense, though the officials in those six posts may simply be renominated. The shape of the next Russian government will provide signals to the country’s course in the coming years.

Around them were bloodstains and their rifles. The soldiers’ relatives identified their bodies from aerial footage gathered by drone. Though excruciating to watch, it seemed clear: The two men — Pvt. Serhiy Matsiuk and Pvt. Andriy Zaretsky — were dead. Yet more than four months later, the Ukrainian military still lists them as missing, even though subsequent drone footage provided by a fellow soldier weeks later showed them still lying there. “I want to have his grave, where I can come and cry all this out properly,” said Private Zaretsky’s wife, Anastasia, 31, who has been looking for closure since he was killed in November in the Zaporizhzhia region in Ukraine’s south. This confusion, and the lengthy, difficult process of obtaining official declaration of the deaths, is far from isolated and has emerged as another painful consequence of the two-year-old war. Families, lawyers and rights groups say that the Ukrainian military is simply overloaded with casualties and unable to account for thousands of the dead, adding to the anguish of soldiers’ families.

Putin’s conservative agenda.","The Russian Army is gradually expanding the role of women as it seeks to balance President Vladimir V. Putin’s promotion of traditional family roles with the need for new recruits for the war in Ukraine. The military’s stepped-up appeal to women includes efforts to recruit female inmates in prisons, replicating on a much smaller scale a strategy that has swelled its ranks with male convicts. Recruiters in military uniforms toured Russian jails for women in the fall of 2023, offering inmates a pardon and $2,000 a month — 10 times the national minimum wage — in return for serving in frontline roles for a year, according to six current and former inmates of three prisons in different regions of Russia. Dozens of inmates just from those prisons have signed military contracts or applied to enlist, the women said, a sampling that — along with local media reports about recruitment in other regions — suggests a broader effort to enlist female convicts. It’s not just convicts. Women now feature in Russian military recruitment advertisements across the country. A pro-Kremlin paramilitary unit fighting in Ukraine also recruits women. “Combat experience and military specialties are not required,” read an advertisement aimed at women that was posted in March in Russia’s Tatarstan region.

The majority were convicted drug sellers or murderers, seeking redemption, money or a path to freedom. They were told they could be killed or maimed. Many of them were. The New York Times obtained exclusive documents providing the fullest picture yet of Russia’s secretive prison recruiting effort, which Moscow is using to replenish the army in its war against Ukraine. Supported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENT A Prison at War: The Convicts Sustaining Putin’s Invasion Aleksandr Mokin had lost the will to live. Convicted of selling drugs and ostracized by his family, he endured abuse from guards and frequent spells in solitary confinement at a high-security Russian prison. He told a friend he felt alone and racked with guilt. Then, in the summer of 2022, Mr. Mokin and other inmates in Penal Colony No. 6 in the Chelyabinsk region started hearing rumors. One of Russia’s most powerful men was reportedly touring jails and offering pardons for prisoners who survived six months of fighting in Ukraine. And by October of last year, there he was, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, standing before them in his military fatigues, himself an ex-con who now ran a private military company, Wagner. He offered freedom and money, even as he warned that the price for many would be death. Mr. Mokin and 196 other inmates enlisted the same day. “I really wish to be there, knowing that this is likely to be a journey without return,” Mr. Mokin, then 35 and serving an 11-year sentence, told a friend in a text message that was viewed by The New York Times. Two months later, Mr. Mokin was dead. A social media post showing his grave is the only known public tribute to his short life. As the war in Ukraine grinds to a stalemate, Mr. Mokin’s ultimate legacy may be his small role in a much bigger, globally significant enterprise: He was one of tens of thousands of convicts powering the Kremlin’s war machine. Even now, with Mr. Prigozhin dead and Wagner disbanded, Russian inmates are still enlisting in what has become the largest military prison recruitment program since World War II. “He said ‘I don’t care where I die, in IK6 or in Ukraine.’” —Valentina, a former spouse of Andrei Vorobei “He was a calm, good person. He ended up in prison out of stupidity, and decided to shorten his sentence.” —Olia, a former colleague of Sergei Monastirshin “He had said that he was sentenced unjustly. Perhaps that affected his decision to go. He only had half a year left to serve.” —Oleg, a friend of Andrei Mingalev “He was a good, brave guy, only the drugs have poisoned his life. In short, he sought death.” —Sergei, a friend of Aleksandr Mokin “He wanted to die as a hero.

One asked for bags of ground coffee because he could not stand the energy drinks supplied by the army. Another simply requested beans: He had taken his own grinder to the front. “I was really shocked,” Mr. Vradii said in a recent interview at his roastery, a 40-foot-high brick building buzzing with the sound of grinding coffee and filled with the smell of freshly ground beans. “Despite the war, people were still thinking about coffee. They could leave their homes, their habits. But they could not live without coffee.” The soldiers’ requests are just one facet of a little-known cornerstone of the Ukrainian lifestyle today: its vibrant coffee culture. Over the past decade, coffee shops have proliferated across Ukraine, in cities large and small. That is particularly true in Kyiv, the capital, where small coffee kiosks staffed by trained baristas serving tasty mochas for less than $2 have become a fixture of the streetscape.

The State Department said in a statement on Wednesday that Russia had used chloropicrin, a “choking agent” widely used during World War I, as well as tear gas, against Ukrainian troops. The use of these gases in warfare is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention, an arms control treaty ratified by more than 150 countries, including Russia. “The use of such chemicals is not an isolated incident and is probably driven by Russian forces’ desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield,” the State Department said. Russia has been slowly but steadily pushing through Ukrainian defenses in the east this year, capturing several towns and villages. The State Department also said that the United States would impose sanctions on three state entities linked to Russia’s chemical and biological weapons programs and four companies that supported them. Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, called the accusations that Russian forces had used chemical weapons “odious and unsubstantiated” in a post on the Telegram messaging app. The Ukrainian authorities have reported about 1,400 cases of suspected chemical weapons use on the battlefield by Russia since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022, and say that the rate has accelerated as Moscow has pressed ahead with attacks along the front line.

Then came Trump and everything after.","Listen to This Article FORT SMITH, Ark. — In the fall of 2020, Kevin Thompson delivered a sermon about the gentleness of God. At one point, he drew a quick contrast between a loving, accessible God and remote, inaccessible celebrities. Speaking without notes, his Bible in his hand, he reached for a few easy examples: Oprah, Jay-Z, Tom Hanks. Mr. Thompson could not tell how his sermon was received. The church he led had only recently returned to meeting in person. Attendance was sparse, and it was hard to appreciate if his jokes were landing, or if his congregation — with family groups spaced three seats apart, and others watching online — remained engaged. So he was caught off guard when two church members expressed alarm about the passing reference to Mr. Hanks. A young woman texted him, concerned; another member suggested the reference to Mr. Hanks proved Mr. Thompson did not care about the issue of sex trafficking. Mr. Thompson soon realized that their worries sprung from the sprawling QAnon conspiracy theory, which claims that the movie star is part of a ring of Hollywood pedophiles. For decades, Mr. Thompson, 44, had been confident that he knew the people of Fort Smith, a small city tucked under a bend in the Arkansas River along the Oklahoma border. He was born at the oldest hospital in town, attended public schools there and grew up in a Baptist church that encouraged him to start preaching as a teenager. He assumed he would live in Fort Smith for the rest of his life. But now, he was not so sure. “Jesus talks about how he is the truth, how central truth is,” Mr. Thompson said in an interview. “The moment you lose the concept of truth you’ve lost everything.” A political moment in which the Supreme Court appears on the brink of overturning Roe v. Wade looks like a triumphant era for conservative evangelicals. But there are deepening cracks beneath that ascendance. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Luego llegó Trump y todo lo demás.","FORT SMITH, Arkansas — En el otoño de 2020, el pastor Kevin Thompson dio un sermón sobre la dulzura de Dios. En algún momento, hizo una breve comparación entre un Dios amoroso y al alcance y las celebridades distantes e inalcanzables. Sin recurrir a apuntes y con la Biblia en la mano, dio algunos ejemplos simples: Oprah, Jay-Z, Tom Hanks. Puesto que la iglesia apenas abría de nuevo para sus servicios religiosos presenciales, el pastor no supo cómo fue recibido su sermón. La asistencia fue escasa y era difícil percibir si sus bromas tenían algún efecto, o si su congregación —compuesta por grupos familiares que estaban separados por tres asientos y otras personas que lo veían por internet— seguía atenta. Así que le sorprendió cuando dos miembros de la iglesia manifestaron su inquietud por la breve referencia que hizo el pastor sobre Hanks. Una joven le mandó un mensaje de texto muy preocupada; otra persona insinuó que la referencia a Hanks era una prueba de que a Thompson no le importaba el tema del tráfico sexual. El pastor pronto se percató de que esos temores eran producto de la extendida teoría conspirativa de QAnon, la cual afirma que esa estrella de cine forma parte de una red de pedófilos de Hollywood. Durante décadas, Thompson, de 44 años, había estado seguro de que conocía a la población de Fort Smith, una ciudad pequeña escondida bajo un recodo del rio Arkansas a lo largo de la frontera de Oklahoma. Thompson nació en el hospital más antiguo de esa ciudad, asistió a escuelas públicas de la localidad y se crio en una iglesia bautista que lo alentó a comenzar a predicar cuando era adolescente. Thompson supuso que viviría en Fort Smith por el resto de su vida. Pero ahora ya no estaba tan seguro. “Jesús habla de cómo él es la verdad, de lo importante que es la verdad”, dijo Thompson en una entrevista. “Cuando pierdes la noción de verdad, has perdido todo”.

Si últimamente estás pasando mucho tiempo en internet —y debido a la pandemia muchos de nosotros lo estamos haciendo— tal vez hayas oído de QAnon, la teoría de conspiración en internet que está creciendo y que ha atraído a algunos de los simpatizantes del presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump. No obstante, a menos que estés demasiado tiempo en línea, quizá todavía tengas preguntas sobre qué está pasando en realidad. Alguna vez, QAnon fue un fenómeno marginal, del tipo que la mayoría de la gente puede ignorar con facilidad. Sin embargo, en estos últimos meses, se ha vuelto popular. Twitter, Facebook y otras redes sociales han sido inundadas con información falsa relacionada con QAnon sobre la COVID-19, las protestas de Black Lives Matter y la elección presidencial de 2020 en Estados Unidos. Los simpatizantes de QAnon también han intentado vincularse a otras causas de activismo, tales como los movimientos antivacunas y las campañas contra el tráfico de menores, en un esfuerzo por hacer crecer sus filas. QAnon también ha permeado el mundo real, ya que algunas de las personas que creen en ella han enfrentado cargos por crímenes violentos, incluido un seguidor de QAnon acusado de asesinar a un capo de la mafia en Nueva York el año pasado y otro que fue arrestado en abril y acusado de amenazar con matar a Joe Biden, el candidato presidencial demócrata. El FBI ha advertido que QAnon representa una potencial amenaza terrorista nacional. La semana pasada, QAnon logró un nuevo hito cuando Marjorie Taylor Greene, una simpatizante declarada de QAnon de Georgia, ganó una elección primaria republicana en un distrito altamente conservador, lo que la perfila para una victoria casi segura en la elección al Congreso de noviembre. Después de la victoria de Greene, Trump la describió como una “futura estrella republicana”. QAnon es una teoría increíblemente complicada y explicar sus corrientes y subteorías podría llenar un libro entero. No obstante, a continuación presentamos algunas cuestiones básicas que debes saber.

But his hair tells its own story.","Imagine if Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the crypto trading firm FTX and defendant in one of the largest financial fraud trials in history, was actually named Samson, rather than Samuel. Like the biblical character, Mr. Bankman-Fried’s symbolic shearing for his courtroom appearance may become a fabled reflection of promise brought low in the tales to come of our digital age. As Mr. Bankman-Fried took the stand on Friday in federal court in Manhattan to begin testifying in his own defense — to explain his actions as having been made in good faith, even if they had bad results — it was hard not to think that his newly cropped do, created by a fellow jail inmate, according to a person familiar with the situation, and paired with a subdued gray suit, white shirt and purple tie, wasn’t just a dress code choice, but a metaphor. An apologia writ in hair about what happens when a muscular intellect is married to frail corporate governance. Why not? Everyone (or every juror) can see a hairdo and relate. Cryptocurrency, not so much. Besides, from the beginning it was by Mr. Bankman-Fried’s hair that so many knew him. The wild halo of dark curls that looked as if it had never met a brush and, according to Michael Lewis in “Going Infinite,” his new book about Mr. Bankman-Fried and FTX, resembled “the hairdo of a lunatic.” The hair that suggested Einstein, electric sockets and some sort of giant brain underneath. The hair that, along with the wrinkled cargo shorts and T-shirts that were Mr. Bankman-Fried’s everyday uniform, suggested “the ultimate billionaire white boy tech flex: I’m so above convention,” as Scott Galloway, an investor, podcast host and professor of marketing, once told The New York Times.

Mr. Zhao pleaded guilty last year to a money-laundering violation, acknowledging that his company allowed terrorist groups and other criminals to have access to its platform. Defense lawyers asked for probation without any prison time, while prosecutors requested a three-year sentence, calling it an “unprecedented” crime. But Judge Richard A. Jones, who oversaw the case in U.S. District Court in Seattle, said in court on Tuesday that Mr. Zhao had taken responsibility for his offenses and was unlikely to break the law again. “Your conduct does not warrant a 36-month sentence,” Judge Jones said. He called Mr. Zhao “a dedicated family man and a giving person” and praised his “staggering accomplishment” in building Binance. Wearing a dark suit and light blue tie, Mr. Zhao, 47, did not visibly react as the sentence was announced. But he nodded vigorously during Judge Jones’s statement and touched his hand to his heart. “I failed here,” Mr. Zhao said in brief remarks to the court. “I deeply regret my failure, and I’m sorry.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

For believers, it was a moment of vindication after a 2022 industry downturn that sent several major companies into bankruptcy and tainted crypto’s reputation. But is crypto really back from the dead? While the numbers suggest the industry is starting to thrive again, there are major differences between this bull run and the euphoria that drove crypto prices to previous highs. Here’s what to know about the new crypto surge. Why did cryptocurrencies collapse in the past? The last time Bitcoin hit a record was November 2021, as cryptocurrencies became a cultural phenomenon. Crypto executives hung out with celebrities, and their companies conducted giant marketing campaigns featuring Super Bowl commercials. Prices crashed in the spring of 2022 as some of the most prominent crypto firms were exposed as frauds. People who had poured their savings into crypto lost everything. The decline culminated in November 2022 when the FTX crypto exchange, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, collapsed after the equivalent of a bank run, costing customers $8 billion. Since then, Bitcoin has been on a tear. After hitting a low of roughly $16,000 after FTX’s implosion, the virtual currency’s price has soared to $69,000. How did Bitcoin rebound? A major turning point for the crypto industry arrived in August when a court ruling paved the way for financial firms to offer new investment products tied to the price of Bitcoin. The products, called exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, gave investors a way to dabble in cryptocurrencies without owning them directly. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

As the supply falls, some analysts anticipate that the digital currency’s price will soar. These reductions happen every four years or so. But this year’s halving has drawn especially enthusiastic attention as the crypto industry rebounds from years of falling prices and corporate implosions. In recent months, Bitcoin’s price has surged to record highs, reaching $73,000 in March. Much of that increase was driven by the approval of new financial products tied to Bitcoin, which spurred billions of dollars in new investment. Crypto investors are hoping that the halving will create a similar effect, causing Bitcoin’s price to climb further. Here’s what to know about the halving. How does the halving work? A key purpose of Bitcoin is to enable people to exchange money without any sort of intermediary, like a bank, verifying the transaction. In place of a bank, a distributed network of computers scattered around the world, all running Bitcoin’s software, performs the verification. To confirm a transaction, the computers solve complicated puzzles, racing one another to guess the answer. This process is designed to ensure that Person A has sufficient funds to send money to Person B. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Here’s What You Should Know. - The New York Times","2024-01-19T14:00:12.000Z","By Tara Siegel Bernard","Federal regulators have made it easier for everyday investors to buy funds that track the price of Bitcoin, using traditional brokerage accounts. Most financial advisers remain skeptical.","Nearly a dozen new investments funds that hold Bitcoin began trading last week, making it easier for anyone with a basic brokerage account to buy a slice of the digital currency. Several established financial institutions, including Fidelity and BlackRock, have coalesced around Bitcoin because it is the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency. But Bitcoin remains an enigma to most everyday investors, and it’s hard to separate the buzz from any true potential. It’s also wildly volatile. In other words, it’s a bet. And institutions are wagering that plenty of investors want in. But putting crypto into a traditional investment wrapper does not paper over the underlying risks. Here’s a look at how it works: What is an exchange-traded fund? Exchange-traded funds are similar to mutual funds, but they can be traded on an exchange like a stock. E.T.F.s track the performance of the assets they hold, which might include a diversified basket of securities like stock or bonds, or even single commodities, like gold, silver and crypto. They were initially designed to track indexes (like the S&P 500) or spheres of the market, and were heralded for their low costs and tax efficiency. But they’ve grown in popularity in recent years. Many E.T.F.s now track narrower and more esoteric slices of the markets, while others use leverage to magnify bets on a specific stock or sector or the market overall. What is a Bitcoin E.T.F.? The Bitcoin exchange-traded products that recently started trading are designed to track Bitcoin’s price, minus the fees and cost of trading. This throws open the gates to any investors with a traditional brokerage account who can now buy the shares as if they were buying stock in Apple or Google.

The mayors also want to use buzzy new tech like NFTs to raise money for public projects.","Scott Conger, the mayor of Jackson, Tenn., campaigned on a modest promise to improve local infrastructure. He planned to build sidewalks, open a senior center and repair the aging storm-water disposal system in his city of 68,000, about halfway between Nashville and Memphis. But as he begins his fourth year in office, Mr. Conger, 38, has adopted a new favorite cause: cryptocurrencies. He has pledged to give city employees the option of converting their paychecks into Bitcoin and has outlined plans to install a digital mining network in a deserted wing of City Hall. The aim, he said, is to make Jackson a Southeastern tech center. Like many Americans, Mr. Conger discovered crypto during the pandemic and soon fell down an internet rabbit hole. His plans have turned him into something of a celebrity in the crypto world, a strange distinction for the leader of a midsize industrial hub where Pringles potato chips are manufactured. “Bitcoin is a great financial equalizer,” Mr. Conger declared this month in an interview at City Hall. “It’s a hedge against inflation. It can bridge that wealth gap.” The ballooning popularity of Bitcoin and other digital currencies has given rise to a strange new political breed: the crypto mayor. Eric Adams, New York’s new mayor, accepted his first paycheck in Bitcoin and another cryptocurrency, Ether. Francis Suarez, Miami’s mayor, headlines crypto conferences. Now even mayors of smaller towns are trying to incorporate crypto into municipal government, courting start-ups and experimenting with buzzy new technologies like nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, to raise money for public projects. Their growing ranks reflect the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital currencies, which are highly volatile and have fallen in value in recent days. The mayors’ embrace of crypto is also a recognition that its underlying blockchain technology — essentially a distributed ledger system — may create new revenue streams for cities and reshape some basic functions of local government.

For more than 10 years, tourism advertisements have painted California as a place for dreamers, a place for adventure and testing your limits by surfing, rock-climbing and skiing. The state tourism agency, Visit California, led the campaign, which invited people from around the world to “Dream Big” and travel to the Golden State. Not anymore. This spring, Visit California replaced “Dream Big” with a new campaign and a new brand for the state, as the “Ultimate Playground.” The scenes in the ads are much the same as before — with the addition of the Rady Shell, San Diego’s outdoor concert venue that opened in 2021 — but there’s no longer any mention of dreams. Caroline Beteta, the chief executive of Visit California, told me there were a number of reasons for the switch, including that branding phrases like “Dream Big” tend to lose power over time and that the concept of dreaming had been popping up elsewhere, in corporate advertising. Another major driver of the “Ultimate Playground” campaign was a more polarized political climate across the United States, which has created antipathy toward California in some parts of the country. Beteta told me that the agency’s consumer research confirmed that Americans increasingly see the world through a political lens, and that framing California as a place to dream about was striking some viewers as a political statement. “Ultimate Playground” seemed to be a safer and less charged message.

They both have round heads, dark eyes, tiny beaks and bodies covered in mottled brown and white feathers. But the birds, which are found in California and the Pacific Northwest, face two very different fates. The barred owl is native to eastern North America, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service considers it to be invasive on the West Coast. The agency has proposed eradicating up to half a million barred owls in Washington, Oregon and California over the next 30 years. Federal officials say that such drastic action is necessary because the barred owl has been encroaching on the territory of the spotted owl for half a century. Populations of the northern spotted owl, a subspecies native to the Pacific Northwest, have declined by as much as 80 percent over the past two decades. There’s concern that the northern spotted owl, which is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, may eventually become extinct. In the Golden State, barred owls have also emerged as a threat to the California spotted owl, a subspecies closely related to the northern spotted owl, in the Sierra Nevada and the mountains of coastal Southern California.

Brown/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images On Thursday morning, the campus at the University of California, Los Angeles, reflected the aftermath of a protest in defeat. Littered across the lawn was a mass of trampled tents, sleeping bags, pizza boxes, blankets and poles. Just hours earlier, as protesters chanted and sprayed fire extinguishers, police officers in riot gear tore down the pro-Palestinian encampment that had dominated a well-known quad at the university for a week. About 200 people were arrested and booked after a standoff with the authorities, according to Nicole Nishida, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Most were charged with misdemeanors such as unlawful assembly, she said, and the majority had been released by midmorning. About 300 protesters left voluntarily, according to the university. Students and faculty have been left struggling to comprehend their university’s response during two days of disorder that disrupted a campus that had supported free speech as long as things remained peaceful. Earlier this week, a violent overnight brawl between those in the encampment and dozens of counterprotesters ended only after Los Angeles authorities finally arrived. The melee had included fistfights, chemicals sprayed into the air and people being kicked or beaten with poles. Many of the participants did not include students. No arrests were made that night. “We’d like some transparency from within the administration and within law enforcement, given the delays and inconsistencies in reaction,” said Jeremy Zwick, a third-year history major at U.C.L.A. “It was a frustrating strategy to witness, and it definitely caused a lot of confusion.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

On Thursday, police removed protesters occupying a library at Portland State University, and administrators at the Rutgers campus in New Brunswick, N.J., set a deadline for students to disperse. Since April 18, when at least 108 protesters were arrested at Columbia University, there have been over 2,000 arrests at more than two dozen campuses. President Biden condemned the protests, saying students have a right to demonstrate but “not a right to cause chaos.” At Columbia, where the protests first took hold, the university president, Nemat Shafik, asked the police to maintain a presence on campus through at least May 17, including commencement, to prevent further encampments or occupations. Arrests have continued, with more than 200 demonstrators taken into custody in the early hours on Thursday at the University of California, Los Angeles.

But how?","Desperate to stem protests that have convulsed campuses across the country, a small number of universities have agreed to reconsider their investments in companies that do business with Israel. The deals, which have eased tension on campuses with only a few days left before students break for the summer, would have been unthinkable even a week ago. And they’re a gamble, potentially putting universities on a collision course with influential donors, politicians and students who support Israel. The schools are still far from pulling money: Brown University, the liberal Ivy League institution, agreed this week only to hold a board vote this fall on whether its $6.6 billion endowment should divest from any Israeli-connected holdings. In exchange, the pro-Palestinian encampment on the campus's main lawn was dismantled. Northwestern University and the University of Minnesota have also struck deals with student protesters to clear camps in exchange for a commitment to discuss the schools’ investment policies around Israel. The moves could add pressure on administrators at Columbia University, the University of Michigan and the University of North Carolina, among others, where protesters have made divestment from Israel a central rallying cry. The issue of financial divestment from Israel has long been an untouchable one, both in American politics and among the Wall Street titans who manage university endowments and make up a large source of donations. Taking sides now is a surefire way to inflame at least one faction in a conflict that has divided campuses, split the Democratic Party and handed Republican lawmakers a cudgel with which to attack the institutions. Even the renewed talk of divestment has raised alarms among the well-heeled donors whom few universities dare cross, and who have exerted influence over the debate on college campuses since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the subsequent invasion of Gaza. Billionaires, including the fund manager William A. Ackman and Marc Rowan, a private-equity chieftain, mounted campaigns to remove the presidents of Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania over their handling of antisemitism on their campuses.

Occupying buildings? Demonstrators cite their right to free expression, but the issues are thorny.","Follow our live coverage of the college protests at U.C.L.A. and other universities. Protesters on college campuses have often cited the First Amendment as shelter for their tactics, whether they were simply waving signs or taking more dramatic steps, like setting up encampments, occupying buildings or chanting slogans that critics say are antisemitic. But many legal scholars, along with university lawyers and administrators, believe at least some of those free-speech assertions muddle, misstate, test or even flout the amendment, which is meant to guard against state suppression. Whose interpretation and principles prevail, whether in the courts or among the administrators in charge of meting out discipline, will do much to determine whether protesters face punishments for campus turmoil. The First Amendment doesn’t automatically apply at private schools. Public universities, as arms of government, must yield to the First Amendment and how the courts interpret its decree that there shall be no law “abridging the freedom of speech” or “the right of the people peaceably to assemble.” But private universities set their own standards around speech and protest. To be sure, private universities tend to embrace free expression more than, say, private businesses. Those policies and approaches, though, are driven by principles like academic freedom and the marketplace of ideas, not constitutional law. Columbia University, a hub through this round of campus protests and the scene of an enormous police response on Tuesday night, has not forbidden all speech. But its current policy includes a set of rules, such as permissible demonstration zones and preregistration of protests, that the university says are intended to ensure safety while promising that “all members of the university community have the right to speak, study, research, teach and express their own views.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

High school seniors say it has been anything but, and some are still unsure of their plans after graduation.","By this time of year, college-bound high school seniors are usually celebrating their choices, researching dorms and even thinking of their majors. This year, that’s not necessarily the case. Because of a disastrous rollout of the new application for federal tuition aid, many still don’t know how much tuition they would be paying and so have not decided where they can afford to go. The Education Department’s redesigned form for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, was supposed to make applying for tuition aid easier and more accessible. But faced with a bureaucratic mess caused by technical meltdowns and severe delays in processing information and receiving aid packages, students say the new system has been anything but clear or streamlined. The first signs of trouble began in December with the form’s release and have cascaded since, creating uncertainties for students — with graduation right around the corner. “It’s been a nightmare from point A to point B,” said Reyna Atkinson, a 17-year-old from Michigan, who ultimately committed to Michigan State University after months of waiting. FAFSA is a free, standardized application for federal aid for college tuition that millions rely on. Students fill out one form, with details on their background and household income, to request tuition information for the schools they list. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Lieutenant Richard Davis of the U.C.L.A. campus police said the protesters arrested in a campus parking deck were charged with conspiracy to attempt burglary. A U.C.L.A. spokesman later said that 44 people had been taken into custody. The arrests came as pro-Palestinian demonstrators attempted a sit-in at Moore Hall, student organizers said. About 30 protesters were sitting in a corner of the parking deck around 9:45 a.m. local time, with their hands zip tied behind them. They were later taken to a sheriff’s bus. Image Students being arrested on the U.C.L.A. campus on Monday.Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York Times The university sent a message telling students and faculty members to avoid Moore Hall and switched to remote classes. Another group of demonstrators amassed in nearby Dodd Hall, where about 40 were inside on Monday morning, chanting, “Disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest.” They later moved outdoors to Bruin Plaza near the center of campus, where about 150 protesters had gathered by late morning. U.C.L.A. administrators originally took a tolerant approach to a pro-Palestinian encampment at the school, even as student protesters were arrested across the nation. But the peace was shattered late Tuesday: Videos analyzed by The New York Times showed pro-Israeli counterprotesters attacking students in the encampment, beating them with sticks, using chemical sprays and launching fireworks as weapons. No arrests have been made in connection with the attack, which the police allowed to continue for hours without intervention. But on Thursday, police officers from three law enforcement agencies arrested more than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators and dismantled their camp. The university said on Sunday that it had created a new campus safety position as it examines what led to clashes between demonstrators there.","U.S.","Not related to Blockchain"

The arrests and aggressive efforts to clamp down on protests underscored just how tumultuous the end of the spring semester has been for universities, many of which are now holding commencements this weekend against the backdrop of tense protests on their campuses. The turmoil has added another complicated layer to graduation for students, many of whom had their high school senior-year celebrations abruptly cut short by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Pro-Palestinian students and their allies, for their part, have signaled that they will continue to challenge their universities over their financial ties to Israel and military companies, to express outrage over the violence in Gaza and to condemn aggressive treatment of protesters on campus. “We aren’t going anywhere,” said Bryce Greene, 26, an Indiana University doctoral student and one of the protest organizers at the school’s campus in Bloomington. Mr. Greene said he believed there would be enough students around campus to sustain the protest over the summer, or until the school agreed to their demands to divest. The arrests at the University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, were among the most prominent on Saturday, after weeks of unrest across the country. In a news release, the university said the protesters had violated school policy on Friday by setting up tents on the lawn and by using megaphones.

Video clips published by the Mississippi Free Press and The Daily Mississippian showed some of the men, who had gathered to counter a pro-Palestinian protest on the school’s campus in Oxford, Miss., directing derogatory, racist and profane remarks at the Black student. One man appeared to hoot and make monkey gestures at her. “The behavior captured in that video is undignified, and it’s just racist, period,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, the first Black woman to serve as White House press secretary, during a press briefing on Tuesday. “It is beneath anyone — anyone — to be sharing that kind of material,” she added. “The actions in the video are beneath any American, and so it is insulting to everyone who has to view it.” At least one student now faces a conduct investigation at the university, Glenn F. Boyce, the school chancellor, said on Friday. He did not identify the student, citing privacy laws, and did not rule out the possibility of more investigations. “Some statements made were offensive, hurtful and unacceptable, including actions that conveyed hostility and racist overtones,” he wrote in a letter to campus. He added, “People who say horrible things to people because of who they are will not find shelter or comfort on this campus.” On Sunday, the headquarters of Phi Delta Theta fraternity said it had removed one person from its membership, adding that the “racist actions” shown in the video clip were “those of an individual and are antithetical to the values of Phi Delta Theta and the Mississippi Alpha chapter.” The fraternity also did not identify the student. While other videos showing the counterprotesters loudly singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” were celebrated online, the videos of the taunts have been widely condemned. Representative Mike Collins, Republican of Georgia, captioned a post with the video of the taunting as “Ole Miss taking care of business.” He later clarified in a statement that “if that person is found to have treated another human being improperly because of their race, they should be punished appropriately, and will hopefully seek forgiveness. “Frankly, I did not believe that to be the focal point of the video shared at the time,” he said. “But I recognize that there certainly seems to be some potentially inappropriate behavior that none of us should seek to glorify.”","U.S.","Not related to Blockchain"

Peters and Jamie Kelter Davis","The university’s president sent in the police to dismantle encampments, which he said had disrupted campus life. Protesters say the school is being hypocritical.","The University of Chicago has built a brand around the idea that its students should be unafraid to encounter ideas or opinions they disagree with. To drum that in, the school provides incoming students with copies of its 2015 free-speech declaration, known as the Chicago statement, which states that freedom of expression is an “essential element” of its culture. And the university has long adhered to a policy of institutional neutrality, which strongly discourages divesting from companies for political reasons, or from making statements aligning it with a social cause. That neutrality, the university argues, allows for a robust, unencumbered exchange of ideas. Many professors swell with pride talking about how the school’s commitment to these principles has endured through two world wars, Vietnam and, more recently, the tumult of the Trump administration. And more than 100 institutions have adopted or endorsed similar principles. But the University of Chicago’s image as the citadel of free speech is being tested again — this time over an encampment on its central quad, where protesters of Israel’s war in Gaza defied orders to leave for more than a week. On Tuesday morning, the university called in police to bring down dozens of tents. When the encampment first went up last week, Paul Alivisatos, the university’s president, said the school wanted to show “the greatest leeway possible for free expression,” and allowed the tents to stay up, even though they were in defiance of a policy against erecting structures in public spaces.

Peters","Roger Ailes understood the appeal Mr. Trump had for Fox viewers. He didn’t foresee how together they would redefine the limits of political discourse.","When Roger Ailes ran CNBC in the mid-1990s, he gave himself a talk show called “Straight Forward.” It long ago vanished into the void of canceled cable programs and never received much attention after the network boss moved on to produce more provocative and polarizing content as chairman of Fox News. But “Straight Forward” was a fascinating window into what kind of people Mr. Ailes considered stars. Donald Trump was one of them. In late 1995, Mr. Ailes invited Mr. Trump, then a 49-year-old developer of condos and casinos, on the show and sounded a bit star-struck as he asked his guest to explain how a Manhattan multimillionaire could be so popular with blue-collar Americans. “The guy on the street, the cabdrivers, the guys working on the road crews go, ‘Hey, Donald! How’s it going?’” Mr. Ailes observed while the two men sat in front of a wood-paneled set piece that gave the studio the appearance of an elegant den in an Upper East Side apartment. “It’s almost like they feel very comfortable with you, like you’re one of them. And I’ve never quite figured out how you bridge that.” Mr. Trump answered by flipping his host’s assertion around. It was because of who hated him: other people with money. “The people that don’t like me are the rich people. It’s a funny thing. They can’t stand me,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “I sort of love it.” What Mr. Ailes sensed about Mr. Trump’s popularity with middle- and working-class Americans in the 1990s would stay with him, because he identified with it. “A lot of what we do at Fox is blue collar stuff,” he said in 2011. His understanding of those dynamics helped shape the coverage he directed for decades and led to an embrace of grievance-oriented political rhetoric that the Republican Party, and a further fragmented right-wing media landscape, is grappling with as it looks toward elections this fall and the possibility of Mr. Trump returning to politics.

That evidence never emerged but a new culprit in a supposed scheme to rig the election did: Dominion Voting Systems, a maker of election technology whose algorithms, Mr. Dobbs said, “were designed to be inaccurate.” Maria Bartiromo, another host on the network, falsely stated that “Nancy Pelosi has an interest in this company.” Jeanine Pirro, a Fox News personality, speculated that “technical glitches” in Dominion’s software “could have affected thousands of absentee mail-in ballots.” Those unfounded accusations are now among the dozens cited in Dominion’s defamation lawsuit against the Fox Corporation, which alleges that Fox repeatedly aired false, far-fetched and exaggerated allegations about Dominion and its purported role in a plot to steal votes from Mr. Trump. Those bogus assertions — made day after day, including allegations that Dominion was a front for the communist government in Venezuela and that its voting machines could switch votes from one candidate to another — are at the center of the libel suit, one of the most extraordinary brought against an American media company in more than a generation. First Amendment scholars say the case is a rarity in libel law. Defamation claims typically involve a single disputed statement. But Dominion’s complaint is replete with example after example of false statements, many of them made after the facts were widely known. And such suits are often quickly dismissed, because of the First Amendment’s broad free speech protections and the high-powered lawyers available to a major media company like Fox. If they do go forward, they are usually settled out of court to spare both sides the costly spectacle of a trial. But Dominion’s $1.6 billion case against Fox has been steadily progressing in Delaware state court this summer, inching ever closer to trial. There have been no moves from either side toward a settlement, according to interviews with several people involved in the case. The two companies are deep into document discovery, combing through years of each other’s emails and text messages, and taking depositions. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Peters and Maggie Haberman","Fox News leaned on the former president privately and publicly to join the debate. But all the while he was proceeding with a plan for his own counterprogramming.","On a cool August night on the crowded patio of his private club in New Jersey, former President Donald J. Trump held up his phone to his dinner companions. The Republican front-runner was having dinner with a Fox News contributor and columnist, Charlie Hurt, when a call came in from another member of the Fox team. The man on the other end of the line, Mr. Trump was delighted to show his guests, was Bret Baier, one of the two moderators of the first Republican debate on Wednesday, according to two people with knowledge of the call. It was Mr. Trump’s second Fox dinner that week. The night before, he had hosted the Fox News president, Jay Wallace, and the network’s chief executive, Suzanne Scott, who had gone to Bedminster, N.J., hoping to persuade Mr. Trump to attend the debate. Mr. Baier was calling to get a feel for the former president’s latest thinking. For months, Fox had been working Mr. Trump privately and publicly. He was keeping them guessing, in his patented petulant way. But even as he behaved as if he was listening to entreaties, Mr. Trump was proceeding with a plan for his own counterprogramming to the debate. The former president has told aides that he has made up his mind not to participate in the debate and has decided to post an online interview with Tucker Carlson that night instead. The interview with Mr. Carlson has already been taped, according to a person with direct knowledge of the event. On Sunday, Mr. Trump confirmed his plans, posting on his website, Truth Social, that he was skipping the debate because he’s leading his rivals in polling and because the public knows “what a successful Presidency I had.” Upstaging Fox’s biggest event of the year would be provocation enough. But an interview with Mr. Carlson — who was Fox’s top-rated prime-time host and is at war with the network, which is still paying out his contract — amounts to a slap in the network’s face by Mr. Trump. The decision is a potential source of aggravation for the Republican National Committee chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, who privately urged him to attend, including in her own visit to Bedminster last month.

Bromwich, Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Swan","Hope Hicks, once a spokeswoman for Donald J. Trump, broke down in tears on the witness stand as she talked about their time together.","Her voice low, her posture tense, the woman who spent years steering Donald J. Trump through strife and scandal stepped to the witness stand on Friday carrying a different burden. She was there under the fluorescent lights of a dreary Manhattan courtroom, seated 15 feet from the former president she once fiercely defended, to testify at his criminal trial. “I’m really nervous,” Hope Hicks, the onetime Trump spokeswoman, messaging maestro and all-around adviser, acknowledged to the prosecutor questioning her, declaring what was already obvious to the riveted courtroom. Ms. Hicks’s unease came to a head hours later as Mr. Trump’s lawyer began to cross-examine her — and she began to cry. As her voice cracked, Mr. Trump locked his eyes on her. The question that initially unnerved Ms. Hicks was about her time at the Trump Organization, the family’s business, where she had fond memories of working. Ms. Hicks left the stand, and the trial paused so that she could compose herself. She returned minutes later to continue her testimony, occasionally dabbing her eyes with a tissue. The striking show of emotion reflected Ms. Hicks’s discomfort with testifying against a man who launched her career and entrusted her with his reputation. Each time the questioning conjured up another memory of working for Mr. Trump — at his company, on his campaign and finally in his White House — Ms. Hicks appeared to fight back tears. Ms. Hicks, who fell out of favor with Mr. Trump once it emerged that she had privately voiced anger at the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters, said in her testimony that they had not spoken in nearly two years.

Bromwich","Donald J. Trump’s books provided prosecutors with passages they believe can help their case, as they argue that he knew that his company falsified business records to cover up a hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels.","Prosecutors cannot force Donald J. Trump to testify at his criminal trial in Manhattan, but that does not mean they can’t use his words against him. On Tuesday, the prosecutors unearthed a series of damaging excerpts from books that the former president wrote, plucking out passages to help make their case against Mr. Trump. In essence, they called a past version of Mr. Trump to testify against his future self. In his own words, Mr. Trump described how he kept a focus on minute details and watched every penny that left his accounts, corroborating a core component of the prosecution’s case as they argue that he knew that his company falsified business records to cover up a hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels, a porn star. On cross-examination, Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Todd Blanche, suggested that a ghost writer had been responsible for these words. Mr. Trump’s written words also described how he sees sexual potential in women that he encounters, a salient point in a trial tethered to encounters with women that he is accused of covering up. “All the women on ‘The Apprentice’ flirted with me,” he wrote. Prosecutors introduced the damning excerpts by questioning Sally Franklin, a witness who is an executive and editor, to read excerpts from “Trump: How to Get Rich” and “Trump: Think Like a Billionaire,” both of which were published by Ballantine, a Penguin Random House imprint. The jury heard Trump’s written words: “Every dollar counts in business, and for that matter, every dime.” The text continued, “Even in high end shops, I bargain,” adding, “I hate paying retail.” This was not the first time jurors heard Trump in his own words. Last week, prosecutors played video clips of him talking, and they have questioned witnesses about Mr. Trump’s infamous statement on the set of “Access Hollywood” that he would grab women by the genitals. But the judge would not allow prosecutors to play the tape for jurors, a decision that elevated the importance of the book passages, or any other opportunity to use Mr. Trump as a witness against himself. It might not be the only opportunity for jurors to hear from the former president. Although the prosecution cannot legally call him to testify, Mr. Trump could take the witness stand in his own defense, though it is unclear whether he will do so. For now, jurors heard his words via Ms. Franklin, who read ominous passages in which Mr. Trump spoke of how he treated his perceived enemies. “For many years I’ve said that if someone screws you, screw them back,” she read from a book by Mr. Trump. It continued: “When somebody hurts you, just go after them as viciously and as violently as you can. Like it says in the Bible, an eye for an eye.” As jurors listened, Mr. Trump’s smiling image on a book cover was plastered on screens across the courtroom, a sharp contrast from the scowl he sported throughout the testimony.","New York","Not related to Blockchain"

Trump’s Monday began with a grave warning from Juan M. Merchan, the judge presiding over the former president’s criminal trial, threatening to imprison him if he continued to flout a gag order. Justice Merchan said that the fines levied against Mr. Trump — $10,000 so far — “are not serving as a deterrent.” The judge said that “therefore, going forward, this court will have to consider jail.” That warning preceded a desert-dry description of a $130,000 payment made by Mr. Trump’s fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to a porn star to buy her silence about her story of a one-night stand in 2006. That testimony was elicited from two employees, one current and one retired, of the Trump Organization. The former president is accused of falsifying business records to cover up that $130,000 payment. Mr. Trump, 77, the first American president to face criminal prosecution, has denied the charges and says he did not have sex with the woman, Stormy Daniels. If convicted, he could face prison time or probation. Here are five takeaways from Mr. Trump’s 12th day on trial: Trump’s comments continue to bring him trouble. Justice Merchan once again found Mr. Trump in contempt for violating his gag order that prohibited attacks on jurors, witnesses, court staff and others. It was Mr. Trump’s 10th violation, and resulted from an April 22 interview in which he said the jury was from “a purely Democrat area,” calling those circumstances “very unfair.” Image Justice Juan M.

It might have been a note of condolence, or sympathy or even a tip. Instead, it was a ransom note, the state police said, one that led to the dramatic rescue later that day of the 9-year-old girl, found hidden in a cupboard in a rundown camper, just 14 miles from her home. The story of how state troopers, S.W.A.T. teams, and other law enforcement officials came to find the child, Charlotte Sena, began with a lucky break and a possible missed opportunity, followed by old-fashioned shoe leather police work. A fingerprint found on the ransom note led investigators to the suspect, who apparently dropped off the note himself — and left without being apprehended, though a trooper had been stationed at the house. The suspect, Craig Nelson Ross, Jr., 46, was arrested at his mother’s home on Monday night and charged with first-degree kidnapping on Tuesday. He pleaded not guilty; additional charges are expected, according to the State Police. Charlotte was said to be in good health and reunited with her parents for the first time since Saturday night, when a weekend camping trip was shattered by the little girl’s disappearance, a sudden vanishing that encapsulated the worst fears of parents everywhere.

Real Life Is Another Story. - The New York Times","2024-01-14T08:00:20.000Z","By Jesse McKinley","Many attempted murder plots, whether instigated by amateurs or professionals, are marred by ineptitude, experts say, despite what happens in “Goodfellas” and “The Sopranos.”","It’s a scene as old as celluloid: a shadowy figure named Luca Brasi or John Wick or Barry Berkman lurking in the darkness, outfitted with sinister intent and nifty weapons, effortlessly committing a murder for cash, animus or cold political calculations. Whether they’re called hit men, contract killers or assassins, figures who kill for a living are a staple of Hollywood thrillers — and, by extension, the public imagination. But experts in law enforcement and international espionage say that murders-for-hire are notoriously difficult to successfully arrange, let alone get away with. Take, for example, what prosecutors say was a recent foiled plot to kill a Sikh separatist in New York City, which American intelligence officials believe was ordered by the Indian government. Once the plot reached the point where the alleged conspirators needed to employ a killer, things got complicated: The would-be hit man turned out to be an undercover agent working for the U.S. government. Robert Baer, a former C.I.A. officer and the author of several books, including “The Perfect Kill: 21 Laws for Assassins,” says he has known many bad guys during his decades in law enforcement and espionage. But even he says finding a real-life killer would stump him. “I could not find you a hit man,” he said. “And I know a lot of murderers.” Dennis Kenney, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, concurred, calling the public perception of a slick, skilled hit man “pretty much myth,” adding that a for-hire killer is usually “nothing more than a thug who offers or agrees to a one-off payday.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

He had told a friend that he thought he was being followed, but that night, he was just eager to celebrate Father’s Day with his family. Mr. Nijjar was heading out of the parking lot in his truck when he was ambushed. Two masked gunmen unleashed a burst of gunfire and then sped off in a getaway car. Mr. Nijjar was dead. The murder that day in June became part of a chain of events that would ricochet around the world, with federal agents in the United States working furiously behind the scenes to untangle an international assassination plot that they believed was directed by someone inside India’s government. The geopolitical implications were huge, and the clock was ticking: The next murder being planned was for someone on U.S. soil. That explosive tip had come into the Drug Enforcement Administration through an unexpected avenue, according to court records and interviews with people familiar with the investigation — accounts that, taken together, provide a detailed picture of how the episode unfolded. What followed was an elaborate sting operation involving an undercover D.E.A. agent posing as a hit man and a wad of $15,000 in cash bills, overseen by a sprawling team of investigators who were able to access private text messages between Indian nationals living in India. This week, federal prosecutors in Manhattan unsealed charges against Nikhil Gupta, a resident of India who was accused of arranging the murder plot in the United States. Officials say the plot targeted a prominent Sikh American activist living in New York City who had been a longtime colleague of Mr. Nijjar, also an outspoken Sikh leader.

He denies the encounter.","For three weeks, witness after witness in Donald J. Trump’s criminal trial has spoken the name of Stormy Daniels, the porn star whose claim of a sexual encounter with the former president is at the center of the case. On Tuesday, jurors heard her tell the story herself, and Mr. Trump silently looked on. The details of the encounter have been public for years, but prosecutors brought in Ms. Daniels to give jurors her personal and explicit account of an assignation in a hotel suite nearly 18 years ago. They had Ms. Daniels describe the day she met Mr. Trump, as an attempt to bolster the credibility of a story that ultimately brought her a hush-money deal days before the 2016 election. Prosecutors say the former president’s effort to hide that payment is the crux of their criminal case against him. Ms. Daniels, 45, was born Stephanie Clifford and raised in Baton Rouge, La. She was a stripper and later starred in pornographic films, becoming a valued “contract girl” for Wicked Pictures. Her encounter with Mr. Trump happened in July 2006, after he became a television star with his reality show, “The Apprentice.” On Tuesday, Ms. Daniels began by testifying about her difficult upbringing in Louisiana before turning to how she had met Mr. Trump in 2006 at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, Nev. They met at the booth for Wicked Pictures, and there is a picture of them together there. She testified that Mr. Trump sought to have dinner with her. At the time, Mr. Trump was 60, and she was 27. Ms. Daniels asked her publicist about attending dinner with Mr. Trump, and the publicist responded, “What could possibly go wrong?” They met at his hotel suite, where he wore pajamas, she said, and described the layout of the room in detail.

Benefit From Huge Tax Breaks - The New York Times","2023-09-26T07:00:17.000Z","By Matthew Haag and Meredith Kolodner","As New York City’s budget tightens, its wealthiest universities are bigger and richer than ever. Now, some officials think it’s time for the schools to pay more in taxes.","As Columbia University puts the last touches on its brand-new campus in Harlem, it has reached a milestone: The university is now the largest private landowner in New York City. In a city where land is more valuable than almost anywhere in the nation, the school now owns more than 320 properties, with a combined value of nearly $4 billion. The growth has helped it stay competitive within the Ivy League and meet its broader ambitions to become a global institution. By many measures, those ambitions have also helped lift the city around it, attracting higher numbers of students, producing new jobs and boosting New York’s reputation as an international center of knowledge. But as Columbia has expanded its footprint, it has also become more of a drain on the city budget because of a state law more than 200 years old that allows universities, museums and other nonprofits to pay almost no property taxes. The law saves Columbia more than $182 million annually, according to an analysis by The New York Times. The amount has soared from $38 million just 15 years ago as the university has bought up more properties and their value has increased. Columbia’s property tax savings, which are a fraction of its $14.3 billion endowment, far exceed the tax breaks granted to many high-profile commercial developments, including large-scale sites like Hudson Yards. They are 50 percent larger than those at Yankee Stadium and greater than the combined tax deals for Citi Field and Madison Square Garden. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Manhattan May Never Be the Same. - The New York Times","2021-03-29T07:00:10.000Z","By Matthew Haag","New York City, long buoyed by the flow of commuters into its towering office buildings, faces a cataclysmic challenge, even when the pandemic ends.","Spotify’s headquarters in the United States fills 16 floors of 4 World Trade Center, a towering office building in Lower Manhattan that was the first to rise on the site of the 2001 terror attacks. Its offices will probably never be full again: Spotify has told employees they can work anywhere, even in another state. A few floors down, MediaMath, an advertising tech company, is planning to abandon its space, a decision fueled by its new remote-work arrangements during the pandemic. In Midtown Manhattan, Salesforce, whose name adorns a 630-foot building overlooking Bryant Park, expects workers to be in the office just one to three days a week. A nearby law firm, Lowenstein Sandler, is weighing whether to renew its lease on its Avenue of the Americas office, where 140 lawyers used to work five days a week. “I could find few people, including myself, who think we are going to go back to the way it was,” said Joseph J. Palermo, the firm’s chief operating officer. A year after the coronavirus sparked an extraordinary exodus of workers from office buildings, what had seemed like a short-term inconvenience is now clearly becoming a permanent and tectonic shift in how and where people work. Employers and employees have both embraced the advantages of remote work, including lower office costs and greater flexibility for employees, especially those with families. Beyond New York, some of the country’s largest cities have yet to see a substantial return of employees, even where there have been less stringent government-imposed lockdowns, and some companies have announced that they are not going to have all workers come back all the time.

That could devastate building owners and cities.","As office vacancies climb to their highest levels in decades with businesses giving up office space and embracing remote work, the real estate industry in many American cities faces a potentially grave threat. Businesses have discovered during the pandemic that they can function with nearly all of their workers out of the office, an arrangement many intend to continue in some form. That could wallop the big property companies that build and own office buildings — and lead to a sharp pullback in construction, steep drops in office rents, fewer people frequenting restaurants and stores, and potentially perilous declines in the tax revenue of city governments and school districts. In only a year, the market value of office towers in Manhattan, home to the country’s two largest central business districts, has plummeted 25 percent, according to city projections released on Wednesday, contributing to an estimated $1 billion drop-off in property tax revenue. JPMorgan Chase, Ford Motor, Salesforce, Target and more are giving up expensive office space, and others are considering doing so. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, the largest private-sector employer in New York City, wrote in a letter to shareholders this week that remote work would “significantly reduce our need for real estate.” For every 100 employees, he said, his bank “may need seats for only 60 on average.” And just as Coca-Cola’s profits would take a seismic hit if consumers abruptly cut back on sodas, owners of office buildings, many of which are owned by pension funds, insurance companies, individuals and other investors, could be pummeled if many businesses rent less space. “The pandemic has proven that work from home is viable,” said Jonathan Litt, chief investment officer of Land & Buildings, a real estate investment firm that has taken a bearish view of the New York office market. “It’s not going away; businesses are going to adjust, and office real estate is going to take it on the chin during that adjustment period.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Experts explain how that can often be before a woman knows she is pregnant.","By the time a woman is considered six weeks pregnant, she would have had two weeks, at most, to realize it. That’s because the gestational age of a fetus is counted not from the moment that sperm fertilizes an egg or from the moment you have a positive pregnancy test, but weeks earlier, on the first day of the previous menstrual cycle. This means that just two weeks after a missed period, a woman is six weeks pregnant, said Dr. Dawnette Lewis, director of Northwell Health’s Center for Maternal Health in New York and a maternal fetal medicine specialist. That’s if someone has a typical menstrual cycle, which lasts about four weeks. But several factors — including stress, perimenopause and certain health conditions — can make the menstrual cycle so unpredictable that it could take longer than six weeks for someone to realize they might be pregnant. “People come in and they’re like, ‘I’ve always had irregular periods and I just thought I was gaining weight’ and lo and behold, they are pregnant,” said Dr. Shruthi Mahalingaiah, a fertility doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor of environmental and reproductive health at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The question of how soon it’s possible to detect and confirm a pregnancy has come into focus as new abortion restrictions have been enacted in 21 states, including in Florida, where a ban on most abortions after six weeks took effect May 1. Florida is the third state to ban abortions at this point in pregnancy. We asked experts to explain how the first six weeks of pregnancy unfold, and what factors might make a pregnancy hard to detect. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, is expected to sign it on Thursday.","Arizona lawmakers voted on Wednesday to repeal an abortion ban that first became law when Abraham Lincoln was president and a half-century before women won the right to vote. A bill to repeal the law passed, 16-14, in the Republican-controlled State Senate with the support of every Democratic senator and two Republicans who broke with anti-abortion conservatives who dominate their party. It now goes to Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, who is expected to sign it on Thursday. The vote was the culmination of a fevered effort to repeal the law that has made abortion a central focus of Arizona’s politics. “We are standing in a moment of Arizona history,” said State Senator Anna Hernandez, a Democrat who called the repeal measure up to a vote on Wednesday. The issue has galvanized Democratic voters and energized a campaign to put an abortion-rights ballot measure before Arizona voters in November. On the right, it created a rift between anti-abortion activists who want to keep the law in place and Republican politicians who worry about the political backlash that could be prompted by support of a near-total abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. The 1864 law had gathered dust on the books for decades. But it exploded into an election-year flashpoint three weeks ago when a 4-2 decision by the State Supreme Court, whose justices are all Republican-appointed, said the ban could now be enforced because of the overturning of Roe v.

She’s done that at The Times since 2016. As recently as the 1990s, when Jason Nageli started off, the home-building industry was still constructing what real-estate ads would brightly call the “starter home.” In the Denver area, he sold newly built two-story houses with three bedrooms in 1,400 square feet or less. The price: $99,000 to $125,000, or around $200,000 in today’s dollars. That house would be in tremendous demand today. But few builders construct anything like it anymore. And you couldn’t buy those Denver area homes built 25 years ago at an entry-level price today, either. They go for half a million dollars. The disappearance of such affordable homes is central to the American housing crisis. The nation has a deepening shortage of housing. But, more specifically, there isn’t enough of this housing: small, no-frills homes that would give a family new to the country or a young couple with student debt a foothold to build equity. The affordable end of the market has been squeezed from every side. Land costs have risen steeply in booming parts of the country. Construction materials and government fees have become more expensive. And communities nationwide are far more prescriptive today than decades ago about what housing should look like and how big it must be. Some ban vinyl siding. Others require two-car garages. Nearly all make it difficult to build the kind of home that could sell for $200,000 today. “It’s just become where you can’t get to that number anymore,” said Mr. Nageli, now the operations manager for the Utah builder Holmes Homes. Nationwide, the small detached house has all but vanished from new construction. Only about 8 percent of new single-family homes today are 1,400 square feet or less. In the 1940s, according to CoreLogic, nearly 70 percent of new houses were that small. The typical new home has grown... ...as the typical household has shrunk.

The Fed held rates steady at 5.3 percent on Wednesday, leaving them at a more than two-decade high, where they have been set since July. Central bankers reiterated that they needed “greater confidence” that inflation was coming down before reducing them. “Readings on inflation have come in above expectations,” Jerome H.

Video transcript Back bars 0:00/0:59 -0:00 transcript ‘Lack of Further Progress’ on Inflation Keeps Interest Rates High Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said that the central bank needed “greater confidence” that inflation was coming down before it decided to cut interest rates, which are at a two-decade high. Today, the F.O.M.C. decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings, though, at a slower pace. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance over the past year. However, in recent months, inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our 2 percent objective, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We’ve stated that we do not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence. In particular, and as I noted earlier, readings on inflation have come in above expectations. It is likely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said that the central bank needed “greater confidence” that inflation was coming down before it decided to cut interest rates, which are at a two-decade high.CreditCredit...Susan Walsh/Associated Press The Fed stands at a complicated economic juncture. After months of rapid cooling, inflation has proved surprisingly sticky in early 2024. The Fed’s preferred inflation index has made little progress since December, and although it is down sharply from its 7.1 percent high in 2022, its current 2.7 percent is still well above the Fed’s 2 percent goal. That calls into question how soon and how much officials will be able to lower interest rates. “What we’ve said is that we need to be more confident” that inflation is coming down sufficiently and sustainably before cutting rates, Mr. Powell said. “It appears that it’s going to take longer for us to reach that point of confidence.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Is the Federal Budget Deficit Making It Worse? - The New York Times","2024-04-29T16:11:51.000Z","By Jim Tankersley","Economists are divided over whether the growing amount of federal borrowing is fueling demand and driving up prices.","A crucial question is hanging over the American economy and the fall presidential election: Why are consumer prices still growing uncomfortably fast, even after a sustained campaign by the Federal Reserve to slow the economy by raising interest rates? Economists and policy experts have offered several explanations. Some are essentially quirks of the current economic moment, like a delayed, post-pandemic surge in the cost of home and auto insurance. Others are long-running structural issues, like a lack of affordable housing that has pushed up rents in big cities like New York as would-be tenants compete for units. But some economists, including top officials at the International Monetary Fund, said that the federal government bore some of the blame because it had continued to pump large amounts of borrowed money into the economy at a time when the economy did not need a fiscal boost. That borrowing is a result of a federal budget deficit that has been elevated by tax cuts and spending increases. It is helping to fuel demand for goods and services by channeling money to companies and people who then go out and spend it. I.M.F. officials warned that the deficit was also increasing prices. In a report earlier this month, they wrote that while America’s recent economic performance was impressive, it was fueled in part by a pace of borrowing “that is out of line with long-term fiscal sustainability.” The I.M.F. said that U.S. fiscal policies were adding about a half a percentage point to the national inflation rate and raising “short-term risks to the disinflation process” — essentially saying that the government was working at cross-purposes with the Fed.

Two-thirds of the roughly 150 currencies tracked by Bloomberg have weakened against the dollar, whose recent strength stems from a shift in expectations about when and by how much the Federal Reserve may cut its benchmark interest rate, which sits around a 20-year high. High Fed rates, a response to stubborn inflation, mean that American assets offer better returns than much of the world, and investors need dollars to buy them. In recent months, money has flowed into the United States with a force that’s being felt by policymakers, politicians and people from Brussels to Beijing, Toronto to Tokyo. The dollar index, a common way to gauge the general strength of the U.S. currency against a basket of its major trading partners, is hovering at levels last seen in the early 2000s (when U.S. interest rates were also similarly high). The yen is at a 34-year low against the U.S. dollar. The euro and Canadian dollar are sagging. The Chinese yuan has shown notable signs of weakness, despite officials’ stated intent to stabilize it. “It has never been truer that the Fed is the world’s central bank,” said Jesse Rogers, an economist at Moody’s Analytics. 120 U.S. dollar index 110 Monthly 100 90 Stronger dollar 80 70 2000 ’05 ’10 ’15 ’20 ’24 120 U.S. dollar index 110 Monthly 100 90 Stronger dollar 80 70 2000 ’05 ’10 ’15 ’20 ’24 Source: Refinitiv By The New York Times We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Says - The New York Times","2024-05-02T13:32:09.000Z","By Liz Alderman","The global economy has proved resilient and inflation has declined, but any widening of the conflict in the Middle East could increase price pressures and dampen growth.","Global inflation is starting to cool after aggressive campaigns by central banks to bring high prices under control, and the economic outlook is brightening after a turbulent period, but clouds loom over the recovery, according to a forecast released on Thursday. The rebound is unfolding at an uneven speed around the world, and geopolitical tensions could pose a major risk to growth and inflation — especially if the conflict in the Middle East and attacks in the Red Sea, a critical shipping zone for trade, were to widen, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a think tank in Paris, said in its latest economic survey. “The global economy has proved resilient, inflation has declined within sight of central bank targets and risks to the outlook are becoming more balanced,” the organization’s secretary-general, Mathias Cormann, said during a news conference Thursday in Paris. “But uncertainty remains.” Inflation among the 38 O.E.C.D. member countries is expected to fall to 4.8 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2025, after hitting 9.4 percent in 2022, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine helped set off an energy crisis. Inflation in the United States and in the euro area is expected to fall this year and next toward a 2 percent target that policymakers say is essential for maintaining the stability of prices. “We’ve been through an inflation shock of a generation,” the organization’s chief economist, Clare Lombardelli, said during the briefing. The biggest price increases have been for essential items like food and energy, she said, adding, “Those on the lowest incomes have been squeezed.” High interest rates have helped bring prices down, but there is still a risk that inflation may stay higher for longer than expected, Ms. Lombardelli said.

The dynamic is bolstering the economic health of the region and keeping the eurozone from slipping too far. In a reversal of fortunes, the laggards have become leaders. Greece, Spain and Portugal grew in 2023 more than twice as fast as the eurozone average. Italy was not far behind. Just over a decade ago, Southern Europe was the center of a eurozone debt crisis that threatened to pull apart the bloc of countries that use the euro. It has taken years to recover from deep national recessions and multibillion-dollar international bailouts with tough austerity programs. Since then, the same countries have worked to mend their finances, attracting investors, reviving growth and exports, and reversing record-high unemployment. Now Germany, Europe’s largest economy, is dragging down the region’s fortunes. It has been struggling to pull itself out of a slump set off by soaring energy prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That was clear on Tuesday, when new data showed that economic output of the euro currency bloc grew 0.3 percent in the first quarter this year from the previous quarter, according to the European Union’s statistics agency, Eurostat. The eurozone economy shrank by 0.1 percent in both the third and fourth quarters of last year, a technical recession. Germany, which accounts for one-quarter of the bloc’s economy, barely avoided a recession in the first quarter of 2024, growing 0.2 percent. Spain and Portugal expanded more than three times that pace, showing that Europe’s economy continues to grow at two speeds. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Listen to this article with reporter commentary A former state glass company in a Havana suburb now houses a showroom for a private business selling Cuban-made furniture. And at the Cuban capital’s port, forklifts carefully unload American eggs from a refrigerated container. The eggs are bound for an online private supermarket that, much like Amazon Fresh, provides home delivery. These ventures are part of an explosion of thousands of private businesses that have opened in recent years across Cuba, a remarkable shift in a country where such enterprises have not been permitted and where Fidel Castro rose to power leading a communist revolution determined to eliminate capitalist notions like private ownership. But today Cuba is confronting its worst financial crisis in decades, driven by government inefficiency and mismanagement and a decades-long U.S. economic embargo that has led to a collapse in domestic production, rising inflation, constant power outages and shortages of fuel, meat and other necessities.

But it warned that risks remain, including stubborn inflation, the threat of escalating global conflicts and rising protectionism. In its latest World Economic Outlook report, the I.M.F. projected global output to hold steady at 3.2 percent in 2024, unchanged from 2023. Although the pace of the expansion is tepid by historical standards, the I.M.F. said that global economic activity had been surprisingly resilient given that central banks aggressively raised interest rates to tame inflation and wars in Ukraine and the Middle East further disrupt supply chains. The forecasts came as policymakers from around the world began arriving in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The outlook is brighter from just a year ago, when the I.M.F. was warning of underlying “turbulence” and a multitude of risks. Although the world economy has proved to be durable over the past year, defying predictions of a recession, there are lingering concerns that price pressures have not been sufficiently contained and that new trade barriers will be erected amid anxiety over a recent surge of cheap Chinese exports. “Somewhat worryingly, progress toward inflation targets has somewhat stalled since the beginning of the year,” Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the I.M.F.’s chief economist, wrote in an essay that accompanied the report. “Oil prices have been rising recently in part due to geopolitical tensions and services inflation remains stubbornly high.” He added: “Further trade restrictions on Chinese exports could also push up goods inflation.” The gathering is taking place at a time of growing tension between the United States and China over a surge of Chinese green energy products, such as electric vehicles, lithium batteries and solar panels, that are flooding global markets. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen returned last week from a trip to China, where she told her counterparts that Beijing’s industrial policy was harming American workers. She warned that the United States could pursue trade restrictions to protect investments in America’s solar and electric vehicle industries. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

But the overall financial outlook of the popular programs remained grim. Annual reports released on Monday by trustees of the old-age and retirement programs showed that both still faced long-term shortfalls that could ultimately result in reduced retirement and medical benefits. The reports showed that the Social Security and disability insurance programs, if combined, would not have enough money to pay all of their obligations in 2035. Medicare will be unable to pay all its hospital bills starting in 2036. About 70 million people receive Social Security benefits, and more than 66 million participate in Medicare. The fate of the popular programs continues to be a contentious political issue, one that is expected to intensify as the November presidential election draws near. President Biden has pledged to block any cuts to Social Security and Medicare and has called for shoring up the programs with higher taxes on the rich. Former President Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, suggested this year that he was open to scaling back the programs when he said there was “a lot you can do in terms of entitlements in terms of cutting.” He later walked back those comments and pledged to protect the programs. In a statement on Monday, Mr. Biden highlighted Republican proposals that would cut Social Security funding and raise the retirement age to qualify for benefits. He promised that he would be a bulwark against such policies. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

The trouble is that inflation was resilient, too. Gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, increased at a 1.6 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. That was down sharply from the 3.4 percent growth rate at the end of 2023 and fell well short of forecasters’ expectations. Economists were largely unconcerned by the slowdown, which stemmed mostly from big shifts in business inventories and international trade, components that often swing wildly from one quarter to the next. Measures of underlying demand were significantly stronger, offering no hint of the recession that forecasters spent much of last year warning was on the way. “It would suggest some moderation in growth but still a solid economy,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America. He said the report contained “few signs of weakness overall.” But the solid growth figures were accompanied by an unexpectedly rapid acceleration in inflation. Consumer prices rose at a 3.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter, up from 1.8 percent in the final quarter of last year. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose at a 3.7 percent annual rate. Taken together, the first-quarter data was the latest evidence that the Federal Reserve’s efforts to tame inflation have stalled — and that the celebration in financial markets over an apparent “soft landing” or gentle slowdown for the economy had been premature.

Edward Moreno","Rates on 30-year mortgages — the most common kind among U.S. homeowners — surpassed the 7 percent mark on Thursday, a troublesome sign for an already tight housing market.","Mortgage rates rose above 7 percent for the first time this year, crossing a symbolically concerning threshold that threatens to keep millions of potential home buyers and sellers on the sidelines of a U.S. housing market that is increasingly showing signs of slowing. The average rate on 30-year mortgages, the most popular home loan in the United States, rose to 7.1 percent this week, Freddie Mac reported on Thursday, the highest since November. Mortgage rates reached a recent high of nearly 8 percent late last year — a level not seen since 2000. As mortgage rates have risen in recent months, making homeownership costlier for buyers, potential sellers who may feel locked into lower rates on their existing loans have been keeping their houses off the market, in effect pushing prices higher, too. Combined, the forces have fed into a broader feeling of frustration about the economy, at a time when inflation has remained hotter than expected. “Potential home buyers are deciding whether to buy before rates rise even more, or hold off in hopes of decreases later in the year,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement. “It remains unclear how many home buyers can withstand increasing rates in the future.” At the same time, the market has slowed. Sales of existing homes fell by 4.3 percent in March and 3.7 percent from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. In April 2021, mortgage rates were at about 3 percent, less than half the current rate. They began to climb that year and continued to rise in 2022 when the Federal Reserve started raising its benchmark rate in an effort to combat inflation. Although inflation has since cooled significantly, it’s still above the central bank’s 2 percent target. The Fed has signaled in recent months that it may keep the cost of borrowing higher for longer amid stubborn inflation. The Fed’s benchmark interest rate is currently the highest it’s been in 22 years. Mortgage lenders generally watch the 10-year Treasury bond, which is tied to mortgage rates, and expectations that the Fed will keep rates high has pushed up Treasury yields. The 10-year Treasury yield has soared since the start of the year, now sitting at about 4.6 percent. The N.A.R. agreed to settle litigation last month that would eliminate the standard sales commission, a move housing experts say could bring down home prices. Sellers currently pay a 5 or 6 percent commission to a real estate agent, a cost that’s typically passed onto the buyer through a higher sticker price.","Business","Not related to Blockchain"

Edward Moreno and Joe Rennison","A cooler-than-expected jobs report for April shifted the tone on Wall Street, rekindling investors’ expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut rates soon.","Just as Wall Street appeared to come to terms with the idea of high interest rates sticking around for longer, a cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday brought the idea of rate cuts back into the conversation. The Labor Department reported that job and wage growth in April came in lower than economists had expected, a shift after months of piping-hot labor market reports. The findings rekindled hopes that the Federal Reserve — which has been looking for signs that interest rates are slowing the economy — may yet cut rates before the end of the year. “This is the jobs report the Fed would have scripted,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. The S&P 500 rose 1.3 percent on Friday, its best day in more than two months. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies that are more sensitive to the ebb and flow of the economy also rose, up 1 percent for the day and also on course to rise for a second consecutive week. Stock investors are sensitive to rapid changes in interest rates, and the two-year Treasury yield tumbled from over 5 percent on Tuesday to 4.8 percent on Friday, a big move in a market that is typically measured in hundredths of a percentage point. Investors had started the week fearful that strong economic data and stubborn inflation would push the Fed to keep interest rates elevated for most of the year and potentially even warrant officials to move them higher. Investors had already welcomed comments on Wednesday from the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, who said it was “unlikely” the central bank would raise rates further, despite earlier intimations from some policymakers that an increase might be necessary given the strength of the U.S. economy this year. Investors now expect the Fed to cut rates at least once and potentially twice this year, with bets that the first cut will come in September, earlier than the November expectation at the start of the week. Investors’ optimism for falling rates also spurred a sell-off in the dollar, a welcome sign for countries around the world whose currencies have been pressured by unexpected dollar strength this year. Expectations that interest rates will come down tends to weigh on a currency as investors look for more lucrative places to park their money. Some investors still cautioned against reading too much into Friday’s jobs data. Jason Pride, a strategist at the asset management firm Glenmede, said investors needed to see more progress before they could expect imminent rate cuts. Another hot jobs or inflation report could be enough to keep the Fed from considering any cuts this year. “One month does not make a trend, but today’s jobs report likely gives the Fed some much-needed assurance that higher rates may be starting to do their job,” Mr. Pride said.","Business","Not related to Blockchain"

A rally in March showed how this can mask turmoil in the rest of the market.","The fate of the S&P 500 index — used by investors as a barometer for the health of corporate America, and cited by presidents as a measure of their handling of the economy — often comes down to just two companies: Apple and Microsoft. The companies that make up the S&P 500, sized by share of market value.

More than $15 trillion in assets, from pension funds and endowments to insurance companies, are linked to the performance of the S&P 500 index in some way, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, with more than 10 cents of every dollar allocated to the broad index flowing through to Microsoft’s and Apple’s market valuation. It is a phenomenon explained by how the benchmark is constructed, and it is amplified by the way tech has come to dwarf other industries, in the markets and the economy. And it means that the two companies together can sway the direction of the broad market, sometimes masking turmoil that has taken place underneath. Trading in March offers a clear example. Even after the failures of two regional banks in the United States and the rescue of a global investment bank in Europe sent a jolt through the financial system and raised new fears about an already fragile global economy, the S&P 500 ended the month up 3.5 percent. Apple and Microsoft accounted for about half of that gain, according to data from S&P. Both were seemingly immune to the banking crisis and boosted by fervor over artificial intelligence, with Apple rising 11.4 percent during the month and Microsoft 15.6 percent. As one of 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500, the tech industry accounts for more than a quarter of the stock index’s value.

Martínez","The Swiss lender had ended Wednesday fighting for its life, with shares at a record low and the cost to insure against a default the highest ever. The loan is an effort to avert further damage.","Credit Suisse said on Thursday that it plans to borrow as much as $54 billion from the Swiss central bank to improve its liquidity after the lender’s shares plunged to a new low. The bank will also access a “short-term liquidity facility” and will buy back about $3 billion in debt, it said in a statement released on its website. Credit Suisse, a 166-year-old institution, ended Wednesday fighting for its life. Its shares tumbled 24 percent on the SIX Swiss Exchange, hitting a new low, and the price of its bonds dropped sharply as well. The cost of financial contracts that insure against a default by the bank spiked to their highest levels on record. After European markets closed on Wednesday, the Swiss National Bank and Finma, the country’s financial regulator, issued a joint statement certifying Credit Suisse’s financial health and saying the central bank would backstop the bank if needed. Hours later, Credit Suisse said it planned to borrow 50 billion Swiss francs from the Swiss National Bank. The immediate catalyst for a perilous drop in the bank’s stock price was a comment by Ammar al-Khudairy, the chairman of the Saudi National Bank, which is the bank’s largest shareholder. In a televised interview with Bloomberg News, Mr. al-Khudairy said that the state-owned bank would not put more money into Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse has been battered by years of mistakes and controversies that have cost it two chief executives over three years. These include huge trading losses tied to the implosions of the investment firm Archegos and the lender Greensill Capital; they also include an array of scandals, from involvement in money laundering to spying on former employees. The firm has embarked on a sweeping turnaround plan, which includes thousands of layoffs and the spinoff of its Wall Street investment bank. But investors have questioned whether continuing losses and client departures — the firm lost about $147 billion worth of customer deposits in the last three months of 2022 — have endangered that effort.","Business","Not related to Blockchain"

Is Stuck  Without a Clear Lifeline - The New York Times","2023-08-11T09:01:14.000Z","By Rob Copeland","David Solomon’s management style is winning few fans amid the elite investment bank’s performance woes. He is mired in “quicksand” and unsure what to do.","One day in mid-June, Lloyd Blankfein called David Solomon, chief executive of Goldman Sachs. Mr. Solomon had not been expecting it. Mr. Blankfein, a big Goldman shareholder and Mr. Solomon’s predecessor, had lost $50 million since January on his stake because of the bank’s sinking stock. He made it clear to Mr. Solomon that his patience was waning, according to three people briefed on the conversation. Mr. Blankfein offered to provide him with more hands-on advice, or even return to the firm in any capacity that might help, the people said. Mr. Solomon, politely but firmly, turned Mr. Blankfein down. It has been a slog for Mr. Solomon. Now in his fifth year as Goldman’s leader, he is struggling to steer the elite investment bank through a humbling stretch that has brought intense focus on his management style. In July, Goldman reported a collapse in profits, the result of a misbegotten foray into consumer banking that the firm is unwinding. Goldman has undergone three rounds of layoffs over the past year. Its stock trails that of its peers. It isn’t just Mr. Blankfein who is fed up. Senior Goldman partners, former executives and investors have expressed frustration with the bank’s performance amid a turnaround plan that has yet to show results. It’s an unusual indication of unrest at a firm whose 400 or so partners have long observed an informal keep-it-in-the-family rule. Goldman’s troubles have also raised questions about the future of Mr. Solomon’s leadership, according to current and former executives involved in deliberations about the firm’s future. Even his own friends lament that his side gig as an amateur DJ has become a needless distraction. Mr. Solomon has also attracted criticism for jet-setting trips, including to private resorts owned by a company in which he has personally invested.

The investment bank, which has spent much of this year unwinding mistakes of years past, reported a profit half as large as that of its rival Morgan Stanley, to say nothing of larger lenders. At Goldman, the pain was distributed across the board, in its investment bank, sputtering consumer arm, slowing trading operations and commercial real estate portfolio. David Solomon, the bank’s chief executive, called it “obviously a tough quarter.” Perhaps in an indication of how low analyst projections had been, shares rose nearly 1 percent on Wednesday. Image The Goldman Sachs headquarters in New York. The bank reported a steep fall in profit in its latest quarter.Credit...Gabby Jones for The New York Times The Numbers Goldman Sachs reported a profit of $1.1 billion in the second quarter, down more than 60 percent from a year earlier. The bank highlighted write-downs in the value of its commercial real estate portfolio, a $1.2 billion hit to profit, and the buy-now-pay-later firm GreenSky, which subtracted nearly $700 million from its earnings. Goldman acquired GreenSky less than two years ago, as part of an ill-fated foray into consumer lending. Quarterly revenue, at $10.9 billion, was 8 percent lower than it was a year earlier. The bank employed 44,600 people at the end of June, down 2,400 from a year earlier. Goldman has gone through at least three rounds of layoffs this year, taking head count down 8 percent so far this year. Takeaways This seems to have been a rip-the-Band-Aid-off quarter for Goldman. The real estate write-down, in particular, appeared to pack potential losses into the period. There are, however, good reasons for the move. Remote or hybrid work appears here to stay, and that has bleak implications for office space and landlords in many cities. Having already conceded some losses in that area, Goldman can now shift attention to other areas of the business like investment banking, which tends to ebb and flow. “It definitely feels better over the course of the last six to eight weeks than it felt earlier in the year,” Mr. Solomon said. Context The big question for Mr. Solomon is whether he can convince investors — and many inside his own firm — of a return to the much-feared Goldman of yore. The bank is nearly a year into an extended apologia for its consumer woes, which at one point included Marcus, a consumer division named after the company’s founder, credit-card offerings and savings accounts aimed at the mass market. The bank said this year that it had lost more than $3 billion tied to those efforts since December 2020. The bank is still unwinding most of the business, at a loss, and it may expect more ugly headlines until that is finished. What’s Next Unlike more diversified lenders like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman relies heavily on its Wall Street franchise, and corporate activity has been muted in the face of economic uncertainty, rising interest rates and the like. That means that if there is a prolonged chill in deal-making, there may be little that the bank can do to fully insulate itself.","Business","Not related to Blockchain"

The largest bank in the nation, JPMorgan Chase, led the way with $14.5 billion in profit, helped by growth virtually across the board, including increases in lending and credit-card transactions. Wells Fargo pulled in $4.9 billion and Citi earned $2.9 billion in the quarter. All of the earnings were higher than analysts had expected. Image JPMorgan Chase’s headquarters in New York. The bank made $14.5 billion in profit last quarter.Credit...Haruka Sakaguchi for The New York Times Why It Matters Given its size, JPMorgan in particular is a proxy for the banking industry. Jamie Dimon, the bank’s chief executive, has deep political connections, and his prognostications on the economy are scrutinized in some circles as closely as a central banker’s musings. On Friday, Mr. Dimon told analysts that he expected the U.S. economy to experience “a soft landing, mild recession or a hard recession,” though he didn’t put a time frame on the prediction. “Obviously, we shall hope for the best,” he said. In its latest report, the bank listed a litany of risks, including that consumers are burning through their cash buffers and that inflation remains high. Last quarter, JPMorgan lost $900 million on investments in U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, which have dropped in value as rates have risen — but that was barely a dent in its results. Wells Fargo, one of the nation’s largest mortgage lenders, is watched by analysts for signs of economic stress. The U.S. economy “continues to perform better than many had expected,” said Charles W.

The thief demanded his iPhone and passcode. Mr. Oriach turned them over and fled. The next morning, Mr. Oriach, who lives in Brooklyn, said he discovered that the thief had drained $8,294 from his bank accounts at Capital One, using multiple money transfer apps including Zelle. He contacted Capital One, fully expecting the bank to refund him the stolen cash, as required by federal law. The bank refunded only $250, saying it found no evidence that the rest of the money was stolen. Mr. Oriach was stunned. “I filed a police report, identified the suspect at a precinct and even testified at a grand jury,” he said. “But none of that seems to have helped my case.” After The New York Times asked Capital One about Mr. Oriach’s case, bank representatives said they had determined there was fraud and would repay him. “We reached out to the customer to apologize for any additional stress this matter has caused,” Capital One said in an emailed statement. In recent years, payment apps like Zelle, Venmo and Cash App have become the preferred way for millions of customers to transfer money from one person to another. Last year, people sent $490 billion on Zelle, the country’s most popular payments app, and $230 billion through Venmo, its closest rival. But the same reasons that have drawn customers to these apps — they are free, fast and convenient — have made them easy targets for scammers and thieves. While banks argue that they shouldn’t have to refund customers who inadvertently granted a scammer permission to use their accounts, they have also often been reluctant to refund customers like Mr. Oriach whose money was stolen.

He was no ordinary patient, and even then — before Covid had its name — he feared that this was no ordinary ailment. Dr. Li was widely regarded in China as a heroic truth-teller. He had been punished by the authorities for trying to warn others about the virus, and then, in a terrible turn, had become severely sickened by it. Weeks later, he would become China’s most famous fatality of the emerging pandemic. He was 34. His death set off an outpouring of grief and anger on a scale and intensity rarely seen in China. More than two years later, Dr. Li remains a galvanizing figure, a symbol of frustration with the government’s suppression of independent voices. His profile on the Chinese social media site, Weibo, regularly receives hundreds of comments a week, and has become a place where people pay tribute and share their personal stories. A government investigation into the circumstances around Dr. Li’s death concluded in a report that the Wuhan Central Hospital had spared no effort to try to save him. But a more complete picture of his medical care and his treatment by the authorities has remained elusive.

We are referring to him only as Dr. B because he is afraid of reprisals from the Chinese government. The Times talked to Dr. B via video, and verified his identity with public information.

157,"92,"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/25/business/crypto-mayors.html","The Rise of the Crypto Mayors - The New York Times","2022-01-25T10:00:23.000Z","By David Yaffe-Bellany","This new political breed accepts paychecks in Bitcoin. The mayors also want to use buzzy new tech like NFTs to raise money for public projects.","Scott Conger  the mayor of Jackson  Tenn.  campaigned on a modest promise to improve local infrastructure. He planned to build sidewalks  open a senior center and repair the aging storm-water disposal system in his city of 68 000  about halfway between Nashville and Memphis. But as he begins his fourth year in office  Mr. Conger  38  has adopted a new favorite cause: cryptocurrencies. He has pledged to give city employees the option of converting their paychecks into Bitcoin and has outlined plans to install a digital mining network in a deserted wing of City Hall. The aim  he said  is to make Jackson a Southeastern tech center. Like many Americans  Mr. Conger discovered crypto during the pandemic and soon fell down an internet rabbit hole. His plans have turned him into something of a celebrity in the crypto world  a strange distinction for the leader of a midsize industrial hub where Pringles potato chips are manufactured. “Bitcoin is a great financial equalizer ” Mr. Conger declared this month in an interview at City Hall. “It’s a hedge against inflation. It can bridge that wealth gap.” The ballooning popularity of Bitcoin and other digital currencies has given rise to a strange new political breed: the crypto mayor. Eric Adams  New York’s new mayor  accepted his first paycheck in Bitcoin and another cryptocurrency  Ether. Francis Suarez  Miami’s mayor  headlines crypto conferences. Now even mayors of smaller towns are trying to incorporate crypto into municipal government  courting start-ups and experimenting with buzzy new technologies like nonfungible tokens  or NFTs  to raise money for public projects. Their growing ranks reflect the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital currencies  which are highly volatile and have fallen in value in recent days. The mayors’ embrace of crypto is also a recognition that its underlying blockchain technology — essentially a distributed ledger system — may create new revenue streams for cities and reshape some basic functions of local government.

Many people began to leave, fearing that Israel was moving ahead with its long-planned invasion of Rafah, despite stiff international pressure. The Israeli military began dropping leaflets in eastern Rafah telling people to move to what it called a humanitarian zone to the north, and said it would also notify people by text messages, phone calls and broadcasts in Arabic, and on Monday night, the Israeli military carried out another round of what it called “targeted strikes” in Rafah against Hamas. Residents told not to return north GAZA STRIP Mediterranean Sea Deir al Balah Residents told to move to this area Khan Younis ISRAEL Area under new evacuation order Rafah Rafah crossing GAZA STRIP EGYPT Kerem Shalom crossing Residents told not to return north GAZA STRIP GAZA STRIP Deir al Balah ISRAEL Residents told to move to this area Khan Younis Area under new evacuation order Rafah Rafah crossing EGYPT Kerem Shalom crossing Source: Israeli military announcement By The New York Times Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement late on Monday that the war cabinet had decided unanimously to “continue with its action in Rafah in order to exert military pressure on Hamas,” though it was not clear if that meant the latest airstrikes or something broader. A military spokesman would not say when troops might enter the crowded city, but described the evacuation as part of Israel’s plans to dismantle Hamas and to free hostages taken on Oct. 7. Hours after the evacuation order, the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, issued a statement that the group had accepted a new cease-fire proposal from Qatar and Egypt, which have acted as intermediaries in peace talks. The group and Israeli officials said it was not referring to the proposal that Israel recently agreed to, leaving the conflict unresolved.
