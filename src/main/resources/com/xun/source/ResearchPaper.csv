"Protecting Privacy in Digital Records: The Potential of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/protecting-privacy-digital-records-potential-privacy-enhancing-technologies","John Werner, Victoria Lemieux","2024-01-09T01:00:00Z","With increased concerns about data protection and privacy over the past several years, and concomitant introduction of regulations restricting access to personal information (PI), archivists in many jurisdictions now must undertake ‘sensitivity reviews’ of archival documents to determine whether they can make those documents accessible to researchers. Such reviews are onerous given increasing volume of records and complex due to how difficult it can be for archivists to identify whether records contain PI under the provisions of various laws. Despite research into the application of tools and techniques to automate sensitivity reviews, effective solutions remain elusive. Not yet explored as a solution to the challenge of enabling access to archival holdings subject to privacy restrictions is the application of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) —a class of emerging technologies that rest on the assumption that a body of documents is confidential or private and must remain so. While seemingly being counterintuitive to apply PETs to making archives more accessible, we argue that PETs could provide an opportunity to protect PI in archival holdings whilst still enabling research on those holdings. In this article, to lay a foundation for archival experimentation with use of PETs, we contribute an overview of these technologies based on a scoping review and discuss possible use cases and future research directions."

"Analogous Analogues: Digital Twins and Hardware Tracking in GLAM Collections","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/analogous-analogues-digital-twins-and-hardware-tracking-glam-collections","Dian Ross, Edmond Cretu, Victoria Lemieux","2024-01-01T01:00:00Z","Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums (GLAMs) are host to cultural treasures and historic records but face inherent challenges maintaining accessibility and traceability in their legacy collections. Rolling COVID-19 lockdowns over the past three years (2020-2023) have limited access to primary materials while user expectation of digital access to collections has grown. With renewed digital access, however, comes new challenges in authentication and provenance tracking: collection digitization and monitoring of cultural artefacts introduces new lines of work for institutions already constrained by budgets and staffing. Building upon our previous exploration of this topic, “NFTs: Tulip Mania or Digital Renaissance?”, we present a design solution for tracking and monitoring GLAM collection objects via a hardware controller with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) that interfaces with a trusted and flexible digital twin ledger architecture, selected from our analysis of database and private ledger technologies. We conclude by outlining the physical threat model for this design: future work will expand this model to include digital (cyber) threats to GLAM collection objects and investigate credentialed queries."
"Will Blockchain Technology Change How Well National Archives Preserve the Trustworthiness of Digital Records?: Preliminary Results of a Survey","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/will-blockchain-technology-change-how-well-national-archives-preserve-trustworthiness","Özhan Sağlık, Victoria Lemieux","2024-01-01T01:00:00Z","The purpose of this study is to examine the viewpoint of national archives on blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, discover their activities in relation to the application of these technologies, and analyse their thoughts on how these technologies can play a role in the preservation of records’ trustworthiness. A survey method was adopted in the study. The survey consisted of 18 questions about national archives’ attitude and actions in relation to application of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. The survey was sent to the 194 national archives listed in the Directory of National Archives. Eighteen responses have been acquired which, while low, provides initial insights into how national archives are responding to these technologies. This study has three hypotheses. The first one is “blockchain technology will change archiving practices”, the second one is “the trustworthiness of digital records can be preserved better with blockchain technology”, and the last one is “national archives are reluctant to implement blockchain networks that use tradable crypto-assets”. According to the results obtained from the survey, the first hypothesis has not been verified. The second hypothesis is likely, as national archives that are keen to adopt blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, but a majority of the archives are hesitant to adopt these technologies for archiving, suggesting that the third and final hypothesis might also true, though the reasons for national archives’ reluctance to adopt these technologies could be more varied than originally hypothesized. This study is one of the first systemic analyses of the viewpoint and activities of national archives on blockchain and distributed technologies."

"Role of Blockchain for IoE Infrastructures and Applications","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/role-blockchain-ioe-infrastructures-and-applications","Ibrahim Tariq, Kashif Naseer Qureshi","2023-12-02T01:00:00Z","Blockchain technology provides a decentralized, secure, tamper proof, and auditable way to store data. In the Internet of Everything (IoE), blockchain can provide a vital role in ensuring the security of a large amount of generated by devices. Blockchain can ensure the integrity and accuracy of IoE data without being controlled by a centralized authority. By leveraging smart contracts to execute business rules between devices, blockchain may automate transactions and streamline procedures in IoE. Furthermore, the creation of decentralized identity management for IoE devices may be facilitated by using blockchain technology, providing a safe method of confirming their validity, and prohibiting unwanted access to the network. It is essential to thoroughly grasp blockchain technology before incorporating it into IoE applications. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of blockchain technology and how it might solve particular problems in the IoE setting. A framework is also suggested for creating blockchain-based IoE application solutions. The IoE ecosystem can gain from improved security and privacy features using blockchain technology, leading to a more dependable and resilient infrastructure."
"Accelerating and Securing Blockchain-enabled Distributed Machine Learning","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/accelerating-and-securing-blockchain-enabled-distributed-machine-learning","Zehua (David) Wang, Yao Du, Cyril Leung, Victor Leung","2023-10-20T00:00:00Z","In the Internet of Things (IoT) employing centralized machine learning, security is a major concern due to the heterogeneity of end devices. Malicious devices could launch poisoning attacks to degrade machine learning models. Distributed machine learning (DML) with blockchain provides a potential solution. Once local weights are recorded on the blockchain, model aggregation with defensive schemes can be executed on smartphones to prevent attacks. However, blockchain with the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism wastes computing resources and adds latency to DML. Computing resources can be utilized more efficiently with proof-of-useful-work (uPoW), which secures transactions by solving relevant real-world problems. We propose a novel uPoW method to minimize per-round latency of DML. The uPoW mining process schedules DML instances among multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers by solving a multi-way number partitioning problem. Moreover, poisoning attacks on heterogeneous training data pose significant challenges to blockchain-based DML. To address this problem, we propose a novel aggregation protocol, named CorrectedKrum , to counter such attacks and improve the convergence speed of DML. By leveraging the mean-field approximation method, training errors are corrected to reduce the negative impact of poisoning attacks. Simulation results show that our proposed blockchain approach can significantly speed up DML compared with benchmarks."
"Blockchain, AI, and Data Protection in Healthcare","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/blockchain-ai-and-data-protection-healthcare","Victoria Lemieux, Meng Kang, Deepansha Chhabra","2023-10-17T00:00:00Z","This chapter contributes to research on the issue of data double spending, or unauthorized secondary use of individuals' data. The chapter describes two solutions that provide decentralized marketplaces for individuals to share their health data for purposes of AI-driven health research – one that uses the Hyperledger Indy/Aries protocol – the ‘Self-Sovereign’ data marketplace – and the other an Ethereum-based solution – the ‘Ocean Protocol’ data marketplace. Based on an implementation of applications using both protocols, the chapter evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of each data marketplace vis-a-vis adherence to fair data processing principles and protecting individuals from data double spending. The chapter contributes to a clearer articulation of fair blockchain-based data processing and the issue of data double spending, an assessment of how well each solution addresses the issue, and possible directions for research aimed at preventing data double spending."
"Backdoor attack and defense in federated generative adversarial network-based medical image synthesis","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/backdoor-attack-and-defense-federated-generative-adversarial-network-based-medical","Xiaoxiao Li, Ruinan Jin","2023-10-06T00:00:00Z","Deep Learning-based image synthesis techniques have been applied in healthcare research for generating medical images to support open research and augment medical datasets. Training generative adversarial neural networks (GANs) usually require large amounts of training data. Federated learning (FL) provides a way of training a central model using distributed data while keeping raw data locally. However, given that the FL server cannot access the raw data, it is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, an adversarial by poisoning training data. Most backdoor attack strategies focus on classification models and centralized domains. It is still an open question if the existing backdoor attacks can affect GAN training and, if so, how to defend against the attack in the FL setting. In this work, we investigate the overlooked issue of backdoor attacks in federated GANs (FedGANs). The success of this attack is subsequently determined to be the result of some local discriminators overfitting the poisoned data and corrupting the local GAN equilibrium, which then further contaminates other clients when averaging the generator’s parameters and yields high generator loss. Therefore, we proposed FedDetect, an efficient and effective way of defending against the backdoor attack in the FL setting, which allows the server to detect the client’s adversarial behavior based on their losses and block the malicious clients. Our extensive experiments on two medical datasets with different modalities demonstrate the backdoor attack on FedGANs can result in synthetic images with low fidelity. After detecting and suppressing the detected malicious clients using the proposed defense strategy, we show that FedGANs can synthesize high-quality medical datasets (with labels) for data augmentation to improve classification models’ performance."
"A Cyber Secure Medical Management System by Using Blockchain","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/cyber-secure-medical-management-system-using-blockchain","Co-authored by: Dr. Ibrahim Tariq","2023-09-01T00:00:00Z","In the pharmaceutical industry, problems like counterfeit drugs, including vaccines, and their supply chain management problems like transparency, immutability, and traceability exist. In the case of vaccines, it becomes more difficult to standardize and detect fake vaccines because the public has less awareness and knowledge about vaccines. Moreover, the increase in online pharmacies gives more opportunities for counterfeiting vaccines to enter the authentic supply chain management system. We present transparent, immutable and secure vaccine supply chain (TISVSchain), a framework based on blockchain to handle the issues of counterfeited vaccines and vaccine supply chain problems like transparency, immutability, and traceability. Our proposed framework can run both on the private and public blockchain. We have implemented the framework on public blockchain by using remix ide and the smart contracts designed by solidity language run on very low gas cost. We also carried out several experiments by changing the number of nodes and their block time to evaluate the performance of our framework in terms of transaction per second (TPS), gas cost, and propagation delay. Our proposed framework improves the security by using offline unique account addresses in blockchain-based frameworks and improves the overall efficiency of the framework by keeping the gas cost low, finding a way to decrease the number of lost blocks to keep low propagation delay, and keeping high TPS value. TISVSchain shows us promising results to improve vaccine supply chain management’s overall performance, security, and efficiency."
"Fast-HotStuff: A Fast and Robust BFT Protocol for Blockchains","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/fast-hotstuff-fast-and-robust-bft-protocol-blockchains","Mohammad Jalalzai, Chen Feng, Jianyu Niu, Fangyu Gai","2023-08-16T00:00:00Z","The HotStuff protocol is a recent breakthrough in Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus that enjoys both responsiveness and linear view change by creatively adding a round to classic two-round BFT protocols like PBFT. Despite its great advantages, HotStuff has a few limitations. First, the additional round of communication during normal cases results in higher latency. Second, HotStuff is vulnerable to certain performance attacks, which can significantly deteriorate its throughput and latency. To address these limitations, we propose a new two-round BFT protocol called Fast-HotStuff, which enjoys responsiveness and efficient view change that is comparable to the linear view-change in terms of performance. Our Fast-HotStuff has lower latency and is more robust against the performance attacks that HotStuff is susceptible to."
"Exploring Blockchain Technology for Chain of Custody Control in Physical Evidence: A Systematic Literature Review","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/exploring-blockchain-technology-chain-custody-control-physical-evidence-systematic","Co-authored by: Danielle Batista","2023-08-03T00:00:00Z","Blockchain technology, initially known for its applications in the financial industry, has emerged as a promising solution for various other domains. One prominent area for the use of blockchain-based solutions is forensics, specifically the chain of custody maintenance and control. While there have been numerous research projects exploring the use of blockchain technology in digital forensics, limited attention has been given to its application in controlling of the physical evidence chain of custody. In this research, we aim to explore the literature on the use of blockchain technology to solve problems related to the physical evidence chain of custody. Through a systematic literature review (SLR), we analyzed 26 resources discussing blockchain-based solutions for evidence chain of custody issues, based on requirements that could be applied to both physical and digital evidence. The results showed that there is a lack of studies involving the use of blockchain technology to solve problems related to the physical evidence chain of custody, and future research should focus on solving the issue."
"‘Life World’ on Ledger: A ‘Scenic’ View","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/life-world-ledger-scenic-view","Victoria Lemieux, Nigel Dodd","2023-06-30T00:00:00Z","This paper explores the sociological and cultural implications of blockchain technology, specifically focusing on three prominent blockchain ecosystems: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Algorand. The study utilizes the concept of the lifeworld, which encompasses collective human perceptions and everyday communicative social interaction, to analyze the formation and perpetuation of lifeworlds within these ecosystems. By employing scene theory as an analytical framework, the research identifies structural and thematic aspects of the lifeworlds represented in the discourse on Reddit and Twitter. The analysis reveals how these virtual spaces shape the unique social orderings, normative politics, and cultural identities associated with each blockchain. The study emphasizes the role of identity expression, cultural attitudes towards money, and the dynamics of boundary work within these scenes. Overall, the paper provides insights into the distinct lifeworlds and dynamics of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Algorand, showcasing the significance of sociocultural factors in blockchain ecosystems and illustrating how a scenes lens offers insights into dynamics at the ecosystem level that may not be visible in an exploration of blockchain technology at the level of technological category."
"AChecker: Statically Detecting Smart Contract Access Control Vulnerabilities","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/achecker-statically-detecting-smart-contract-access-control-vulnerabilities","Asem Ghaleb, Karthik Pattabiraman, Julia Rubin","2023-06-30T00:00:00Z","As most smart contracts have a financial nature and handle valuable assets, smart contract developers use access control to protect assets managed by smart contracts from being misused by malicious or unauthorized people. Unfortunately, programming languages used for writing smart contracts, such as Solidity, were not designed with a permission-based security model in mind. Therefore, smart contract developers implement access control checks based on their judgment and in an ad-hoc manner, which results in several vulnerabilities in smart contracts, called access control vulnerabilities. Further, the inconsistency in implementing access control makes it difficult to reason about whether a contract meets access control needs and is free of access control vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose AChecker – an approach for detecting access control vulnerabilities. Unlike prior work, AChecker does not rely on pre-defined patterns or contract transactions history. Instead, it infers access control implemented in smart contracts via static data-flow analysis. Moreover, the approach performs further symbolic-based analysis to distinguish cases when unauthorized people can obtain control of the contract as intended functionality. We evaluated AChecker on three public datasets of real-world smart contracts, including one which consists of contracts with assigned access control CVEs, and compared its effectiveness with eight analysis tools. The evaluation results showed that AChecker outperforms these tools in terms of both precision and recall. In addition, AChecker flagged vulnerabilities in 21 frequently-used contracts on Ethereum blockchain with 90% precision."

A key mechanism that these systems rely on to provide both of these features is transaction broadcast. Unfortunately, in today's systems, the broadcast protocols are highly inefficient. The wide adoption of public blockchain systems increases the importance of high performance blockchain infrastructure that offers both high throughput and low transaction confirmation latency. Underlying such infrastructures is a fast, efficient, and robust transaction broadcast mechanism. We present Mercury, a new transaction broadcast protocol designed for high performance blockchains. Mercury shortens the transaction propagation delay using two techniques: a virtual coordinate system (VCS) and an early outburst strategy. Our simulation results show that Mercury outperforms prior propagation schemes and decreases overall propagation latency by up to 44%. When implemented in Conflux, an open-source high-throughput blockchain system, Mercury reduces transaction propagation latency by over 50% with a bandwidth overhead of less than 5%."

Thus, vehicles can reduce the burden of local computing and improve computing efficiency by offloading tasks to roadside computing servers or neighboring resource-idle vehicles for execution via cooperative computation offloading (CO). However, dynamic communication channel states and data handover among multiple VEC servers caused by vehicle mobility pose challenges for CO decision-making and data security. This article applies blockchain to the cooperative CO of VEC and thus proposes a cooperative CO and secure handover framework with a consensus mechanism to guarantee the efficiency of cooperative CO and secure handover. In this framework, models for vehicle mobility and cooperative CO handover are constructed, and a consensus mechanism is proposed. This mechanism ensures the synchronization and immutability of offloaded data in the CO handover. A cooperative CO decision optimization is also formulated considering secure handover with blockchain technology to optimize the latency of vehicular computing tasks. To solve this complex problem, this optimization is transformed into a Markov decision process and a cooperative CO decision algorithm with multiagent deep reinforcement learning is designed, thus achieving the optimal solution. Extensive simulations verified the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method."

"World State Attack to Blockchain Based IoV and Efficient Protection With Hybrid RSUs Architecture","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/world-state-attack-blockchain-based-iov-and-efficient-protection-hybrid-rsus","Co-authored by: Victor Leung","2023-04-27T00:00:00Z","Blockchain technology is developing rapidly and has been widely applied in the field of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to solve trust and security problems. However, due to the high security requirements in IoV scenarios, the security threats of blockchain itself become a big challenge for its applications in IoV. As the largest distributed platform supporting smart contract, Ethereum becomes one of the popular blockchain platforms that has been applied in IoV applications. In Ethereum, the local world state (stored on Road Side Units (RSUs) in IoV) is applied to facilitate account query and transaction verification. However, previous works showed that the local database can be easily tampered, so attackers may issue invalid transactions based on the modified world state, which is not acceptable for IoV applications. In this paper, the success probability and expected time for such an attack are first analyzed theoretically, including the effect of portion of tampered RSUs and the number of required confirmation blocks. Then experiment evaluation verifies the correctness of the theoretical analysis and shows that the attack would succeed with a higher probability within a shorter time when the local database on more RSUs are attacked. On the contrary, increasing of confirmation blocks can effectively reduce the success probability of a single attack and extend the confirmation time of the invalid transaction. Finally, efficient attack detection and recovery methods are proposed based on a novel hierarchical architecture with hybrid RSUs, and the effectiveness and complexity are verified by theoretical analysis and experiments."

However, there are two major issues preventing the use of a P2P architecture, namely how to provide an effective distributed data storage solution, and how to tackle potential cheating behaviors. Inspired by emerging blockchain techniques, we propose a novel consensus model called Proof-of-Play (PoP) to provide a decentralized data storage system that incorporates an anti-cheating mechanism for P2P games, by rewarding players that interact with the game as intended, along with consideration of security measures to address the Nothing-at-stake Problem and the Long-range Attack. To validate our design, we utilize a game-theory model to show that under certain assumptions, the integrity of the PoP system would not be undermined due to the best interests of any user. Then, as a proof-of-concept, we developed a P2P game (Infinity Battle) to demonstrate how a game can be integrated with PoP in practice. Finally, experiments were conducted to study PoP in comparison with Proof-of-Work (PoW) to show its advantages in various aspects."

To address these challenges, we propose a blockchain-based approach to assess the quality of data that are not independent and identically distributed (non-IID). A blockchain running atop mobile edge computing (MEC) is helpful to protect privacy, security, and integrity of healthcare data when IoT devices are connected to MEC servers. Therefore, it is critical to integrate data quality assessment module on blockchain when building a blockchain-enabled DML system. In this paper, we jointly consider information loss and marginal utility of non-IID data samples. Specifically, we use Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to evaluate the information loss between IID and non-IID data samples and apply the reciprocal of data quantity to model the marginal utility of data samples. Human activities and handwritten digit recognition data sets are used for performance evaluations. Experiments show that our proposed scheme outperforms benchmarks regarding model test accuracy on various non-IID data samples."

A PIR scheme is v-verifiable if the client can verify the correctness of the retrieved xi even when v≤k servers collude and try to fool the client by sending manipulated data. Most of the previous works in the literature on PIR assumed that v<k, leaving the case of all-colluding servers open. We propose a generic construction that combines a linear map commitment (LMC) and an arbitrary linear PIR scheme to produce a k-verifiable PIR scheme, termed a committed PIR scheme. Such a scheme guarantees that even in the worst scenario, when all servers are under the control of an attacker, although the privacy is unavoidably lost, the client won't be fooled into accepting an incorrect xi. We demonstrate the practicality of our proposal by implementing the committed PIR schemes based on the Lai-Malavolta LMC and three well-known PIR schemes using the GMP library and blst, the current fastest C library for elliptic curve pairings."

The Solidity language (in its early versions) provides features to exercise fine-grained control over smart contracts, whose usage is discouraged by later-released Solidity documentation, but nonetheless supported in later versions for backward compatibility. We define these features as low-level functions. However, the high-volume of transactions and the improper use of low-level functions lead to security exploits with heavy financial loss. Consequently, the documentation suggests secure alternatives to the use of low-level functions. In this article, we first perform an empirical study on the use of low-level functions in Ethereum smart contracts. We study a smart contract dataset consisting of over 2,100,000 real-world smart contracts. We find that low-level functions are widely used and that the majority of these uses are gratuitous. We then propose GoHigh, a source-to-source transformation tool to eliminate low-level function-related vulnerabilities, by replacing low-level functions with secure alternatives. Our experimental evaluation on the dataset shows that GoHigh successfully replaces all low-level functions with 4.9% fewer compiler warnings. Further, no unintended side-effects are introduced in 80% of the contracts, and the remaining 20% are not verifiable due to their external dependency. GoHigh saves more than 5% of the gas cost of the contract. Finally, GoHigh takes 7 s on average per contract."

These attacks have one common cause: block withholding. This paper proposes Crystal, which leverages quorum certificates to resist block withholding misbehavior. Crystal continuously elects committees from miners and requires each block to have a quorum certificate, i.e., a set of signatures issued by members of its committee. Consequently, an attacker has to publish its blocks to obtain quorum certificates, rendering block withholding impossible. To build Crystal, we design a novel two-round committee election in a Sybil-resistant, unpredictable and non-interactive way, and a reward mechanism to incentivize miners to follow the protocol. Our analysis and evaluations show that Crystal can significantly mitigate selfish mining and double-spending attacks. For example, in Bitcoin, an attacker with 30% of the total computation power will succeed in double-spending attacks with a probability of 15.6% to break the 6-confirmation rule; however, in Crystal, the success probability for the same attacker falls to 0.62%. We provide formal end-to-end safety proofs for Crystal, ensuring no unknown attacks will be introduced. To the best of our knowledge, Crystal is the first protocol that prevents selfish mining and double-spending attacks while providing safety proof."
"Defining Digital Trust Ecosystems","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/defining-digital-trust-ecosystems","Trinh Nguyen","2022-10-14T00:00:00Z","The concept of “ecosystem” has been increasingly adopted in data management, innovation, and business strategy. Yet, more often it is used metaphorically without a specific reference to the literature. At the Trust over IP Foundation, defining digital trust ecosystems is crucial in crafting a digital governance framework. This paper draws on the characteristics of natural ecosystems and human economies to propose a definition of digital trust ecosystems as interconnected communities of diverse institutional and individual participants in a trust environment sustained by the combined governance of technology and human actors. Characteristics of digital trust ecosystems, the role of the ToIP Foundation, and the challenges of sustaining digital trust ecosystems are discussed."
"InFEDge: A Blockchain-Based Incentive Mechanism in Hierarchical Federated Learning for End-Edge-Cloud Communications","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/infedge-blockchain-based-incentive-mechanism-hierarchical-federated-learning-end-edge","Co-authored by: Victor Leung","2022-10-14T00:00:00Z","Advances in communications and networking technologies are driving the computing paradigm toward the end-edge-cloud collaborative architecture to leverage ubiquitous data and resources. Opposite to centralized intelligence, Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) relieves overwhelmed communication overhead and enjoys the advantages of high bandwidth as well as abundant computing resources while retaining privacy-preserving benefits of Federated Learning (FL). It is difficult to balance system overhead and model performance in the HFL framework, while it could be solved by introducing an incentive mechanism. Although the incentive mechanism can alleviate the above anxiety by compensating relevant participants, some limitations (multi-dimensional properties, incomplete information and unreliable participants) will significantly degrade the performance and efficiency of the designed mechanism. To address the challenges caused by the above limitations, we propose InFEDge, a blockchain-based incentive mechanism in the HFL. The InFEDge considers 1) multi-dimensional individual properties to model system participants and proves the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium with the closed-form solution. Meanwhile, 2) we transform the problem under incomplete information into a contract game where we obtain the optimal solution. Moreover, 3) we also leverage the blockchain to provide economic incentives, prevent unreliable participants’ disturbance and further ensure data privacy by implementing the mechanism in the smart contract to offer a credible, faster, and transparent resource trading system. Experimental evaluations on a proof-of-concept testbed along with real traces demonstrate the superiority of our mechanism. Further, our method solves a real-world user allocation problem for future communications and networking."

However, leader-based BFT consensus protocols used by permissioned blockchains have limited scalability and robustness. To alleviate the leader bottleneck in BFT consensus, we introduce Stratus, a robust shared mempool protocol that decouples transaction distribution from consensus. Our idea is to have replicas disseminate transactions in a distributed manner and have the leader only propose transaction ids. Stratus uses a provably available broadcast (PAB) protocol to ensure the availability of the referenced transactions. We implemented and evaluated Stratus by integrating it with state-of-the-art BFT-based blockchain protocols and evaluated these protocols in both LAN and WAN settings. Our results show that Stratus-based protocols achieve up to 5∼20× more throughput than their native counterparts in a network with hundreds of replicas. In addition, the performance of Stratus degrades gracefully in the presence of network asynchrony, Byzantine attackers, and unbalanced workloads. Our design provides easy-to-use APIs so that other BFT systems suffering from leader bottlenecks can use Stratus."

Revocation checking for vehicle certificates is an indispensable procedure in the process of authentication to protect vehicular networks from attacks by non-legitimate vehicles. However, revocation checking introduces procedures that requires additional time to process which challenges latency-sensitive applications in vehicular networks. This challenge grows more evidently when considering the factor of privacy preservation. In this paper, we propose to offload partial revocation task to network edges to lighten the revocation process in vehicles. Particularly, we design a method to achieve decentralized Global Certificate Revocation List (GCRL) management in network edges using permissioned blockchain technologies. In the method, both tamper-proof property and quick synchronization of the GCRL are guaranteed. Besides, our method can detect illegal revocation behaviours by validation in vehicles. Finally, we build a prototype of our proposed solution based on Hyperledger Fabric, and compare with Proof-of-Work scheme in terms of blockchain synchronization latency performance."

Xinjiang has recently shifted into the spotlight of the international press for allegations of abuse and forced labor, coercive cultural assimilation, and the creation of a police state. The leadership of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) justifies the existence of these training facilities and expansive surveillance networks as part of the PRC-backed efforts to de-radicalize ethnic groups in the region. However, many governments and scholars rebuke these justifications, arguing that these centers are state-run facilities that house extrajudicially detained individuals based on their ethnic identity and religious belief. This paper aims at limiting the plausible deniability of violations conducive to cultural genocide, thus improving the prospects for deterrence and accountability through decentralized evidence management. The technological sophistication of the regime in Xinjiang is outpacing centralized systems and rendering storage solutions hosting evidence of these violations obsolete. This jeopardizes the prospect of truth and reconciliation in the future and allows the party to craft and disseminate their narrative globally with little resistance. Major findings focus on how decentralized systems can improve the streamlining and hosting of evidence regarding human rights violations occurring as well as advancing the study of cryptographic management of evidence regarding the treatment of vulnerable communities in low-rights regions."

In addition, MEC fills the gap between cloud computing and terminals in vehicular networks. In the MEC system, to reduce the load on MEC servers with large-scale vehicle deployment and promote the efficient use of network resources, vehicles can also transfer tasks to neighboring resource-rich vehicles using cooperative computation offloading. However, cooperative computation offloading between vehicles faces the challenges of security and insufficient information about the server vehicle. Therefore, this paper proposes using blockchain technology to achieve efficient data sharing between vehicles and service providers (i.e., server vehicles) and ensure the security of computation offloading between vehicles. First, we design a secure data sharing architecture in blockchain-based vehicular edge computing networks. Then, a new consensus mechanism in this architecture is proposed to improve the efficiency of data sharing and prevent malicious attacks. Furthermore, we present a cooperative offloading decision-making method using an offloading game, and the Nash equilibrium of the offloading strategy is achieved using this method. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method."

It is yet facing critical challenges in its decentralized management and security, limiting its capabilities to support services with numerous requirements. In this context, blockchain (BC) has been seen as a promising solution to tackle the above issues, and further support EI. Based on the number of citations or the relevance of emerging methods, this paper presents the results of a literature survey on the integration of EI and BC. Accordingly, we summarize the recent research efforts reported in the existing works on EI and BC. We then paint a comprehensive picture of the limitations of EI and why BC could benefit from EI. From there, we explore how BC benefits EI in terms of computing power management, data administration, and model optimization. In order to narrow the gap between immature BC and EI-amicable BC, we also probe into how to tailor BC to EI from four perspectives, including flexible consensus protocol, effective incentive, intellectuality smart contract, and scalability. Finally, some research challenges and future directions are presented. Different from existing surveys, our work focuses on the integration of EI and BC, develops some general models to help the reader build relevant optimization models in the integrated system, as well as provides detailed tutorials on implementation. We anticipate that this survey will motivate further discussions on the synergy of EI and BC, and offer some guidance in EI, BC, future networks, and other areas."

Decentralized machine learning (DML) with blockchain is a potential solution. However, blockchain with proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism wastes computing resources and adds latency to DML. Computing resources can be utilized more efficiently with proof-of-useful-work (uPoW), which secures transactions by solving real-world problems. We propose a novel uPoW method that exploits PoW mining to accelerate DML through a task scheduling framework for multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems. To provide a good quality-of-service for the system, we minimize the latency by solving a multi-way number partitioning problem in the extended form. A novel uPoW-based mechanism is proposed to schedule DML tasks among MEC servers effectively.

However, existing solutions cannot meet the strict requirements of high throughput and low latency in high-density scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel MAC protocol to meet such demands for VANETs. The roadside unit (RSU) pattern and the dual-transceiver manner are adopted to assign channel resources for all packets. The striking features of our approach are twofold: the time slot allocation based on global vehicle information and the consideration of different delay requirements of different applications. First, we design a time slot exchange mechanism, which avoids any transmission conflict between two adjacent RSUs, to reduce channel resource waste. Then, we design a packet weight allocation mechanism, by which the packets of any network edge area are assigned higher priorities to further reduce channel resource waste. Moreover, we devise a packet quality evaluation mechanism, by which our multi-objective problem is transformed into a single-objective problem. In addition, we devise a greedy branch-and-bound algorithm to address the multiple-knapsack problem, which is transformed into a single-knapsack problem. Extensive simulation results show the advantages of our approach in terms of throughput and latency."

Dfinity Consensus is a state-of-the-art synchronous Byzantine consensus protocol. However, Dfinity is vulnerable to the withholding attack. For example, adversaries can strategically withhold blocks, resulting in an increase in latency and unbounded message complexity. Motivated by this observation, we present Dfinity++, which can effectively defend such an attack. The key idea behind Dfinity++ is simple. Since honest replicas would timely publish their blocks, one can detect delayed blocks and then trigger a fast switch to the next iteration, leading to better resource usage. Our results show that against a static/mildly adversary, Dfinity++ is able to reduce the latency (of committing a new block) by 10.7%, and at the same time enjoys a message complexity of O(n2)."

A contract execution proceeds as long as the users dedicate enough gas, within the limit set by Ethereum. If insufficient gas is provided, the contract execution halts and changes made during execution get reverted. Unfortunately, contracts may contain code patterns that increase execution cost, causing the contracts to run out of gas. These patterns can be manipulated by malicious attackers to induce unwanted behavior in the targeted victim contracts, e.g., Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. We call these gas-related vulnerabilities. We propose eTainter, a static analyzer for detecting gas-related vulnerabilities based on taint tracking in the bytecode of smart contracts. We evaluate eTainter by comparing it with the prior work, MadMax, on a dataset of annotated contracts. The results show that eTainter outperforms MadMax in both precision and recall, and that eTainter has a precision of 90% based on manual inspection. We also use eTainter to perform large-scale analysis of 60,612 real-world contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. We find that gas-related vulnerabilities exist in 2,763 of these contracts, and that eTainter analyzes a contract in eight seconds, on average."

The author argues that focusing on information-processing efficiency over the defense of records against manipulation and corruption (the ancient task of the recordkeeper) has contributed to a diminution of the trustworthiness of information and a rise of disinformation, with attendant destabilization of the epistemic trust fabric of societies. Readers are asked to consider the potential and limitations of blockchains as the technological embodiment of the moral defense of the record and as means to restoring societal trust in an age of disinformation."

This solution brings together advances from the fields of identity management, confidential computing, and advanced data usage control. In the area of identity management, the solution is aligned with emerging decentralized identity standards: decentralized identifiers (DIDs), DID communication and verifiable credentials (VCs). In respect to confidential computing, the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme is incorporated with the system to protect the privacy of the individual’s data and prevent unauthorized secondary use when being shared with potential users. In the area of advanced data usage control, the solution leverages the PRIV-DRM solution architecture to derive a novel approach to licensing of data usage to prevent unauthorized secondary usage of data held by individuals.

While account credentials in the form of text-based passwords have been employed as an authentication mechanism since the 1970s, some security experts have argued the password’s ineffectiveness. Passwords can either be the cause of a data breach or information that is compromised during a data breach. Our investigation examines the difference in annual firm profit, annual sales, and annual operating expenses between firms that experience an account credential data breach and firms that experience a non-account credential data breach. To conduct our investigation, we use data breach incident information from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse website and financial data from the Standard & Poor’s Compustat database. In our panel dataset, we identify 89 data breach incidents that involved account credentials out of our total sample of 937 incidents from years 2005-2019. Overall, our results indicate that firms that experience an account credential data breach have lower annual profit and lower annual sales compared to firms that experience a non-account credential data breach. However, we do not find a statistically significant difference in average operating expenses. Our findings suggest that it would be worthwhile to focus information security efforts on improving identity and access management practices since incidents that involve account credentials may lead to more negative financial consequences."

In this paper, we propose an integrated blockchain and MEC (IBM) framework based on a space-structured ledger to meet the transaction demands for IoT applications. In the framework, a collaborative mining process is designed, where we consider the cooperation between mobile devices (MDs) and MEC servers. To promote mining efficiency, we further develop a high-performance consensus mechanism called reputation-based proof of work (Re-PoW), in which differentiated mining targets are assigned according to the reputation of MDs. In the Re-PoW consensus mechanism, heterogeneous capabilities and historical behaviors of MDs are all considered for accurately evaluating their reputation. In addition, we present an alternating optimization algorithm by jointly optimizing bandwidth allocation and computation resource allocation to further enhance the performance of the proposed scheme.

In this article, based on the linear secret sharing scheme (LSSS), an efficient scheme is proposed to realize a collaborative decryption function. For any user group, when the user’s attribute set cannot access the ciphertext alone, the private key of other users in the same group can be used for collaborative decryption with the permission of the data owner. Our scheme uses the LSSS matrix that can significantly reduce the computation and storage overhead when comparing with the existing schemes. Then, a multiauthorization model is created based on the Bohen–Lynn–Shacham technology in order to solve the key-management issue. Finally, we implemented the specific functions of the framework through JAVA, and built a private chain to verify the feasibility of data transfer between users."
"Efficient Blockchain-Enabled Large Scale Parked Vehicular Computing With Green Energy Supply","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/efficient-blockchain-enabled-large-scale-parked-vehicular-computing-green-energy","Co-authored by: Victor Leung","2021-07-27T00:00:00Z","While the vehicular network enables geographically distributed cooperative computation, its mature implementation has long been constrained due to the lack of an effective management platform. In this paper, employing the security and privacy attributes of blockchain, we propose a novel Blockchain-enabled Large-scale Parked Vehicular Computing (BLPVC) architecture to utilize the potential solar energy and vehicular computational resources in the outdoor parking lot. However, the uneven green power supply and random arrival time of electric vehicles compose the highly complex environment. Accordingly, in this paper, to handle the efficient utilization of the distributed resources by blockchain technology, we propose an integrated optimization framework which leverages the green energy utilization and service latency limit among the processes of block generation, task computing, and communication, whereas such a design leads to the mixed-timescale stochastic optimization problem. To this end, corresponding to the dynamic solar energy arrival, we propose a shaped deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to accelerate the learning rate of computational frequency control in the short-term stage; while in the long-term stage, for the mixed-integer programming (MIP) of task offloading and blockchain parameters adjustment, a series of transformation is employed to preserve convexity. Finally, experiments are carried out on Python demonstrating that the proposed scheme achieves a balanced performance between service latency and distributed resources, while the battery depreciation cost is heavily reduced."
"Profit Maximizing Smart Manufacturing Over AI-Enabled Configurable Blockchains","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/profit-maximizing-smart-manufacturing-over-ai-enabled-configurable-blockchains","Co-authored by: Victor Leung","2021-07-22T00:00:00Z","Based on the trustless feature of blockchain, this article designs a general configurable blockchain-enabled smart manufacturing system to achieve flexible manufacturing in response to large-scale manufacturing services. With a transaction pool containing all the pending manufacturing tasks but aligning with the logic flow, the complex manufacturing structure can be uniformly tackled. Furthermore, in virtue of the contradiction between large-scale manufacturing and limited blockchain throughput, we formulate a joint optimization of the block size, task scheduling, and the supply-demand configuration to maximize the customers’ net profit with the probabilistic delay requirements, which addresses the critical issue of efficiency and latency in the blockchain-based live manufacturing process. Meanwhile, the production quality and price preference are involved. For solution, a mixed online bipartite matching-based DQN algorithm is proposed, which circumvents the high dimensionality by separating the task-manufacturer matching from the time-correlated problem. Simulation results show that the proposed flexible framework can well adopt to dynamic customer population, and achieves better convergence."
"Addressing Audit and Accountability Issues in Self-Sovereign Identity Blockchain Systems Using Archival Science Principles","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/addressing-audit-and-accountability-issues-self-sovereign-identity-blockchain-systems","Victoria Lemieux, Artemij Voskobojnikov, Meng Kang","2021-07-13T00:00:00Z","Self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems are novel blockchain-based solutions that are said to shift the control of data records from organizations to individuals. Contrary to conventional blockchains, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, many SSI systems do not capture on ledger the exchange of transactional data between individuals. By not capturing the exchange of transaction data such SSI systems have the advantage of complying with privacy regulations such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations, but, at the same time, have the disadvantage of not capturing evidence that an exchange has happened. Such evidence, however, may be needed for audit and accountability purposes. To achieve these objectives and to preserve privacy, we leverage archival principles to introduce a novel concept of a proof registry, which we define as a set of technical components, data structures, and process flows, that assures that authoritative records offering evidence of transactions is captured, stored, and accessible. This solution solves the compliance and accountability problem while preserving the self-sovereignty and privacy of involved parties."

Although blockchain and machine learning technologies (especially deep learning and deep reinforcement learning) may provide the next promising use case for IIoT, they are working in an adversarial way to some extent. While blockchain facilitates the data collection that is critical for machine learning under the premise of data regulation rules like privacy protection, it may suffer from privacy leakage due to big data analytics with the help of machine learning. To make machine learning and blockchain useful and practical for diversified services in industrial sectors, it is of paramount importance to have a comprehensive understanding of the development of both technologies in the context of IIoT. To this end, in this paper we summarize and analyze the applications of blockchain and machine learning in IIoT from three important aspects, i.e., consensus mechanism, storage and communication. This survey provides a deeper understanding on the security and privacy risks of the key components of a blockchain from the perspective of machine learning, which is useful in the design of practical blockchain solutions for IIoT. In addition, we provide useful guidance for future research in the area by identifying interesting open problems that need to be addressed before large-scale deployments of IIoT applications are practicable."
"Blockchain-Assisted Secure Fine-Grained Searchable Encryption for a Cloud-Based Healthcare Cyber-Physical System","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/publications/blockchain-assisted-secure-fine-grained-searchable-encryption-cloud-based-healthcare","Co-authored by: Victor Leung","2021-04-28T00:00:00Z","The concept of sharing of personal health data over cloud storage in a healthcare-cyber physical system has become popular in recent times as it improves access quality. The privacy of health data can only be preserved by keeping it in an encrypted form, but it affects usability and flexibility in terms of effective search. Attribute-based searchable encryption (ABSE) has proven its worth by providing fine-grained searching capabilities in the shared cloud storage. However, it is not practical to apply this scheme to the devices with limited resources and storage capacity because a typical ABSE involves serious computations. In a healthcare cloud-based cyber-physical system (CCPS), the data is often collected by resource-constraint devices; therefore, here also, we cannot directly apply ABSE schemes. In the proposed work, the inherent computational cost of the ABSE scheme is managed by executing the computationally intensive tasks of a typical ABSE scheme on the blockchain network. Thus, it makes the proposed scheme suitable for online storage and retrieval of personal health data in a typical CCPS. With the assistance of blockchain technology, the proposed scheme offers two main benefits. First, it is free from a trusted authority, which makes it genuinely decentralized and free from a single point of failure. Second, it is computationally efficient because the computational load is now distributed among the consensus nodes in the blockchain network. Specifically, the task of initializing the system, which is considered the most computationally intensive, and the task of partial search token generation, which is considered as the most frequent operation, is now the responsibility of the consensus nodes. This eliminates the need of the trusted authority and reduces the burden of data users, respectively. Further, in comparison to existing decentralized fine-grained searchable encryption schemes, the proposed scheme has achieved a significant reduction in storage and computational cost for the secret key associated with users. It has been verified both theoretically and practically in the performance analysis section."

These paths are also hampered by significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, services provisioning, and network management. Blockchain, which is a technology for building distributed ledgers that provide an immutable log of transactions recorded in a distributed network, has become prominent recently as the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies and is revolutionizing data storage and processing in computer network systems. For future data-driven networks (DDNs), blockchain is considered as a promising solution to enable the secure storage, sharing, and analytics of data, privacy protection for users, robust, trustworthy network control, and decentralized routing and resource managements. However, many important challenges and open issues remain to be addressed before blockchain can be deployed widely to enable future DDNs. In this article, we present a survey on the existing research works on the application of blockchain technologies in computer networks and identify challenges and potential solutions in the applications of blockchains in future DDNs. We identify application scenarios in which future blockchain-empowered DDNs could improve the efficiency and security, and generally the effectiveness of network services."

A new paradigm, combined with decades of research in BFT SMR and blockchain (namely chained-BFT, or cBFT), has emerged for directly constructing blockchain protocols. Chained-BFT protocols have a unifying propose-vote scheme instead of multiple different voting phases with a set of voting and commit rules to guarantee safety and liveness. However, distinct voting and commit rules impose varying impacts on performance under different workloads, network conditions, and Byzantine attacks. Therefore, a fair comparison of the proposed protocols poses a challenge that has not yet been addressed by existing work. We fill this gap by studying a family of cBFT protocols with a two-pronged systematic approach. First, we present an evaluation framework, Bamboo, for quick prototyping of cBFT protocols and that includes helpful benchmarking facilities. To validate Bamboo, we introduce an analytic model using queuing theory which also offers a back-of-the-envelope guide for dissecting these protocols. We build multiple cBFT protocols using Bamboo and we are the first to fairly compare three representatives (i.e., HotStuff, two-chain HotStuff, and Streamlet). We evaluated these protocols under various parameters and scenarios, including two Byzantine attacks that have not been widely discussed in the literature. Our findings reveal interesting trade-offs (e.g., responsiveness vs. forking-resilience) between different cBFT protocols and their design choices, which provide developers and researchers with insights into the design and implementation of this protocol family."

Inspired by J. Göbel’s selfish mining model in the presence of propagation delay, we propose a competition model based on spatial Poisson process to study how delay influences the revenue distribution when there are more than one selfish miners. Based on our model, we derive the exact expression of the revenue distribution, and prove that the difference of propagation delays between two selfish miners significantly affects the distribution of mining rewards. Additionally, we find that the required threshold of the mining power for multiple selfish miners is larger than that for a single one. Finally, we discuss how the propagation delay impacts the state transfer machine of each selfish miner."

First, the impact of network capacity is ignored. Second, an integrated incentive analysis that jointly considers both key blocks and microblocks is still missing. In this paper, we aim to address these two limitations. First, we propose a new incentive analysis that takes the network capacity into account, showing that Bitcoin-NG can still maintain incentive compatibility against the microblock mining attack even under limited network capacity. Second, we leverage a Markov decision process (MDP) to jointly analyze the incentive of both key blocks and microblocks, showing that the selfish mining revenue of Bitcoin-NG is a little higher than that in Bitcoin only when the selfish miner controls more than 35% of the mining power. We hope that our in-depth incentive analysis for Bitcoin-NG can shed some light on the mechanism design and incentive analysis of next-generation blockchain protocols."

These new opportunities have spawned numerous studies on edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI), even the cooperation between them, referred to as edge intelligence. However, there are a number of handicaps that prevent edge intelligence from being used as a generic platform. The most intractable one is the heterogeneity and un-credibility among edges, hindering the way of sharing the learning results reliably, flexibly, and efficiently. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-assisted edge intelligence (B-EI) approach to solve the problem. The edge learning nodes train their local intelligence, followed by the improved blockchain to share the local intelligence, constructing edge intelligence among the heterogeneous and uncredible edges. Specifically, the improved blockchain employs a novel learning-measured consensus protocol, named Proof of Learning. The edges, also acted as the blockchain nodes, compete to have more superior local intelligence, instead of solving a hashed result. The superior local intelligence is then shared and distributed with other edges. It is not only beneficial to achieve edge intelligence, but also efficient to employ the computation resource, by replacing the hashing as the intelligence training. In order to show the potential benefits, we then use the proposed B-EI approach to solve a joint resource assignment problem. Simulation results show that our scheme outperforms the other state-of-art solutions, in terms of training episodes, and resource utility."

Very little is known about health care consumers’ intentions to adopt the applications. Objective: This study aims to explore the intentions and concerns of health care consumers regarding the adoption of blockchain-based personal health records and data sharing. Methods: Three focus groups were conducted, in which 26 participants were shown a prototype of a user interface for a self-sovereign blockchain-based PHR system (ie, a system in which the individual owns, has custody of, and controls access to their personal health information) to be used for privacy and secure health data sharing. A microinterlocutor analysis of focus group transcriptions was performed to show a descriptive overview of participant responses. NVivo 12.0 was used to code the categories of the responses. Results: Participants did not exhibit a substantial increase in their willingness to become owners of health data and share the data with third parties after the blockchain solution was introduced. Participants were concerned about the risks of losing private keys, the resulting difficulty in accessing care, and the irrevocability of data access on blockchain. They did, however, favor a blockchain-based PHR that incorporates a private key recovery system and offers a health wallet hosted by government or other positively perceived organizations. They were more inclined to share data via blockchain if the third party used the data for collective good and offered participants nonmonetary forms of compensation and if the access could be revoked from the third party. Conclusions: Health care consumers were not strongly inclined to adopt blockchain-based PHRs and health data sharing. However, their intentions may increase when the concerns and recommendations demonstrated in this study are considered in application design."

A smart manufacturer needs to track the location and state of materials from its suppliers and products to its customers/distributors to manage the corresponding production schedule. The need for such information can be fulfilled by the use of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices installed at each respective party. However, even though all parties may trust one another, they have confidential data produced by the IIoT devices that are not allowed to be shared with other parties, or only allowed to be exchanged with certain parties. Even though the data are not confidential, they may still be required to share partial data based on the needs of each party. On the other hand, all parties have their independent systems that differ from each other, which leads to complex integration. Regarding those situations, a private-blockchain-based IIoT is promising to bridge the need for product and material tracking information exchange between parties while maintaining the respective confidentiality."

It uses a clever three-chain commit rule to achieve responsiveness while the vast majority of BFT protocols are using the standard two-chain commit rule. This brings us to a fundamental question: Is a three-chain commit rule really necessary to achieve responsiveness? In this paper, we answer this question by designing a two-chain variant of HotStuff called Fast-HotStuff that still enjoys responsiveness with simplified view change. Compared to the three-chain HotStuff, Fast-HotStuff has lower latency and is more resilient against forking attacks. Moreover, Fast-HotStuff can be combined with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) while still maintaining safety and liveness. In sharp contrast, HotStuff and its variant LibraBFT (which plans to use PoS) fail to have this property as malicious replicas can take over the network. In order to achieve all of these advantages, Fast-HotStuff adds a small amount of overhead information during the block proposal phase, which is only needed if the previous primary replica fails. The correctness of Fast-HotStuff is established in terms of safety and liveness. The effectiveness of Fast-HotStuff is demonstrated through experimental results."

"Incentive Analysis of Bitcoin-NG, Revisited","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/research/research-papers/incentive-analysis-bitcoin-ng-revisited","Chen Feng, Jianyu Niu, Ziyu Wang","2020-10-02T00:00:00Z","Bitcoin-NG is among the first blockchain protocols to approach the \emph{near-optimal} throughput by decoupling blockchain operation into two planes: leader election and transaction serialization. Its decoupling idea has inspired a new generation of high-performance blockchain protocols. However, the existing incentive analysis of Bitcoin-NG has several limitations. First, the impact of network capacity is ignored. Second, an integrated incentive analysis that jointly considers both key blocks and microblocks is still missing. In this paper, we aim to address these two limitations. First, we propose a new incentive analysis that takes the network capacity into account, showing that Bitcoin-NG can still maintain incentive compatibility against the microblock mining attack even under limited network capacity. Second, we leverage a Markov decision process (MDP) to jointly analyze the incentive of both key blocks and microblocks, showing that the selfish mining revenue of Bitcoin-NG is a little higher than that in Bitcoin only when the selfish miner controls more than 35\% of the mining power. We hope that our in-depth incentive analysis for Bitcoin-NG can shed some light on the mechanism design and incentive analysis of next-generation blockchain protocols."

However, with continuously increasing number of vehicles on road, there are numerous challenges associated with IoV. Communication among vehicles is needed to be secure and bandwidth efficient. Messages exchanged between vehicles must be authentic so as to maintain trust among the network. On the other hand, blockchain is a rapidly emerging technology for various IoT related applications. It ensures security by maintaining transaction history in the form of an encrypted and immutable ledger. Therefore, blockchain-based communications can potentially solve various challenges of IoV. However, there are certain constraints which make the practical implementation of blockchain in IoV difficult. For example, one of the most common consensus algorithms of blockchain, Proof-of-Work, is energy inefficient and time consuming. Various other consensus algorithms have been developed but they compromise security. This chapter conceptualises the implementation of blockchain in IoV, particularly useful in emergency situations, such as accident. We discuss some consensus algorithms of blockchains and their suitability in IoV, ultimately leading to a formation of voting based consensus integrated with a relay selection mechanism. Furthermore, we present an economic model to incentivise vehicles for safe driving and cooperation through blockchain-enabled transaction of rewards. The security capacity of proposed blockchain against collusion of relay nodes is analysed by game theory. Simulation results of the proposed approach demonstrate its efficiency in terms of latency and success rate in message transmission as compared to other blockchain-based solutions for IoV."

A distinguishing feature is that linear combinations of codewords can sometimes be decoded more efficiently than codewords themselves. The present work further develops this framework by studying the simultaneous decoding of multiple messages. Specifically, consider a receiver in a multi-user network that wishes to decode several messages. Simultaneous joint typicality decoding is one of the most powerful techniques for determining the fundamental limits at which reliable decoding is possible. This technique has historically been used in conjunction with random i.i.d. codebooks to establish achievable rate regions for networks. Recently, it has been shown that, in certain scenarios, nested linear codebooks in conjunction with “single-user” or sequential decoding can yield better achievable rates. For instance, the compute–forward problem examines the scenario of recovering L≤K linear combinations of transmitted codewords over a K -user multiple-access channel (MAC), and it is well established that linear codebooks can yield higher rates. This paper develops bounds for simultaneous joint typicality decoding used in conjunction with nested linear codebooks, and applies them to obtain a larger achievable region for compute–forward over a K -user discrete memoryless MAC. The key technical challenge is that competing codeword tuples that are linearly dependent on the true codeword tuple introduce statistical dependencies, which requires careful partitioning of the associated error events."
"How effective are smart contract analysis tools? evaluating smart contract static analysis tools using bug injection","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/research/research-papers/how-effective-are-smart-contract-analysis-tools-evaluating-smart-contract","Asem Ghaleb, Karthik Pattabiraman","2020-07-16T00:00:00Z","Security attacks targeting smart contracts have been on the rise, which have led to financial loss and erosion of trust. Therefore, it is important to enable developers to discover security vulnerabilities in smart contracts before deployment. A number of static analysis tools have been developed for finding security bugs in smart contracts. However, despite the numerous bug-finding tools, there is no systematic approach to evaluate the proposed tools and gauge their effectiveness. This paper proposes SolidiFI, an automated and systematic approach for evaluating smart contracts’ static analysis tools. SolidiFI is based on injecting bugs (i.e., code defects) into all potential locations in a smart contract to introduce targeted security vulnerabilities. SolidiFI then checks the generated buggy contract using the static analysis tools, and identifies the bugs that the tools are unable to detect (false-negatives) along with identifying the bugs reported as false-positives. SolidiFI is used to evaluate six widely-used static analysis tools, namely, Oyente, Securify, Mythril, SmartCheck, Manticore and Slither, using a set of 50 contracts injected by 9369 distinct bugs. It finds several instances of bugs that are not detected by the evaluated tools despite their claims of being able to detect such bugs, and all the tools report many false positives."

At the same time, the message transmitted by the relay can be wiretapped by an passive eavesdropper. The lower bound on the ergodic secrecy rates and the approximated secrecy outage probabilities of users are analyzed with closed-form solutions considering imperfect SIC. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the correctness of theoretical analysis, reflect the influence of the key parameters on the system performance and verify the better secrecy performance of the proposed scheme than its counterpart."

In addition, the large volume of data and massive end devices may bring serious security, privacy, services provisioning, and network management challenges. In order to achieve decentralized, secure, intelligent, and efficient network operation and management, the joint consideration of blockchain and machine learning (ML) may bring significant benefits and have attracted great interests from both academia and industry. On one hand, blockchain can significantly facilitate training data and ML model sharing, decentralized intelligence, security, privacy, and trusted decision-making of ML.

We identify several important aspects of integrating blockchain and ML, including overview, benefits, and applications. Then we discuss some open issues, challenges, and broader perspectives that need to be addressed to jointly consider blockchain and ML for communications and networking systems."

Recent advances of blockchain technology allow some startups to realize decentralized collaborative transcoding through device-to-device (D2D) networks, where a group of transcoders are selected to perform transcoding cooperatively. For the blockchain-enabled D2D transcoding systems, it's imperative to jointly design transcoder selection, task scheduling and resource allocation schemes in order to provide efficient and trustworthy transcoding services. In this paper, viewing the involved multi-dimensional complex factors and channel fluctuation, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based transcoder selection framework for blockchain enabled D2D transcoding systems where both the platform dynamics and channel statistics are captured. To reduce the action space size, we adopt a two-stage decision approach to first select the transcoders through a normal DRL based framework and then obtain the optimal task scheduling, power control, and resource allocation scheme by solving a stochastic optimization problem with the constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) approach. Simulation results show that our proposed framework can achieve high transcoding revenue while meeting the quality of service (QoS) requirements, and it can well handle dynamic cases."

Existing solutions, such as broadcasting, are effective in flooding a message to a wider area, however, they are inherently unreliable and bandwidth inefficient. Furthermore, it is difficult to both assess the authenticity of a message and maintain the privacy of sender in a single solution. Moreover, as a practical solution, there is a need of economic modeling to incentivise vehicles for safe driving and cooperation. This paper proposes a blockchain based message dissemination approach which utilises incentive distribution and reputation management to overcome these challenges. Specifically, with the proposed voting based consensus algorithm, it can assess the authenticity of a message and select the most suitable relay node for its dissemination in a completely decentralised fashion. Meanwhile, the blockchain based integrated incentive and reputation scheme encourages the cooperation among vehicles and strengthens its ability to deliver authentic messages. The security capacity of the proposed solution is demonstrated by a game theoretic analysis. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can save average consensus time by 11% and improve success rate of authentic message dissemination by 17% with less number of hops as compared to the existing solutions."

From finding a vaccine, to ramping up testing, repurposing supply chains, tracing contacts and tracking compliance with quarantine orders, governments everywhere are pulling out all the stops to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the solutions being deployed rely upon novel technologies that potentially pose a threat to individuals’ privacy (DeCell, 2020). Much ink has been spilled in recent weeks discussing in equal measure the promise and the perils of these technologies in a perceived trade-off between the immediate necessity of beating the novel Coronavirus and the less immediate but also concerning loss of personal privacy. As a result, government officials face hard policy choices, often without clear guidelines to follow or knowledge of the range of policy and technology options. While some tracking and tracing technologies may threaten personal privacy, UBC researchers have been working together on novel blockchain-based technologies that could enable capabilities needed to fight COVID-19, such as the issuance of “immunity certificates”, while still protecting individuals’ privacy. This rapid publication working group will bring together experts on ethical, legal, and social implications of public health technologies to 1) explore the challenges, risks, and benefits of deploying novel technologies in the response to COVID-19, 2) open a dialogue with public health officials and the public about the challenges, risks and benefits, and 3) use the exploration and dialogue to write a public policy paper (for publication) that lays out the challenges, risks and benefits and sets out a framework that can be used in public policy decision-making and technology design. The working group will adapt the Witness Seminar methodology outlined in Tansey (2006) to enable exploration and online participation and engagement. This seminar was held on May 5, 2020, and a transcript of the discussion will be available shortly. Witness seminars provide a platform to gather numerous participants who are recorded simultaneously and able to interact with each other and with the seminar convenor. The Witness Seminars produce group discussions on the topic of interest and make collective materials available for widespread use. A broad range of “witnesses” with diverse perspectives were invited to attend, from public health officials, to biomedical scientists, information ethicists, legal experts, technology experts, civil libertarians, the media, and members of the public."

Strategic Information Governance Disruptions in the Era of Blockchain and Distributed Trust","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/research/research-papers/caught-middle-strategic-information-governance-disruptions-era-blockchain","Victoria Lemieux, Chris Rowell","2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","Distributed trust technologies, such as blockchain, propose to permit peer-to-peer transactions without trusted third parties. Yet not all implementations of such technologies fully decentralize. Information professionals make strategic choices about the level of decentralization when implementing such solutions, and many organizations are taking a hybrid (i.e. partially decentralized) approach to the implementation of distributed trust technologies. This paper conjectures that while hybrid approaches may resolve some challenges of decentralizing information governance, they also introduce others. To better understand these challenges, this paper aims first to elaborate a framework that conceptualizes a centralized–decentralized information governance continuum along three distinct dimensions: custody, ownership and right to access data. This paper then applies this framework to two illustrative blockchain case studies – a pilot Brazilian land transfer recording solution and a Canadian health data consent sharing project – to exemplify how the current transition state of blockchain pilots straddles both the old (centralized) and new (decentralized) worlds. Finally, this paper outlines the novel challenges that hybrid approaches introduce for information governance and what information professionals should do to navigate this thorny transition period. Counterintuitively, it may be much better for information professionals to embrace decentralization when implementing distributed trust technologies, as hybrid models could offer the worst of both the centralized and future decentralized worlds when consideration is given to the balance between information governance risks and new strategic business opportunities."

In addition, the large volume of data and massive end devices may bring serious security, privacy, services provisioning, and network management challenges. In order to achieve decentralized, secure, intelligent, and efficient network operation and management, the joint consideration of blockchain and machine learning (ML) may bring significant benefits and have attracted great interests from both academia and industry. On one hand, blockchain can significantly facilitate training data and ML model sharing, decentralized intelligence, security, privacy, and trusted decision-making of ML. On the other hand, ML will have significant impacts on the development of blockchain in communications and networking systems, including energy and resource efficiency, scalability, security, privacy, and intelligent smart contracts. However, some essential open issues and challenges that remain to be addressed before the widespread deployment of the integration of blockchain and ML, including resource management, data processing, scalable operation, and security issues. In this paper, we present a survey on the existing works for blockchain and ML technologies. We identify several important aspects of integrating blockchain and ML, including overview, benefits, and applications. Then we discuss some open issues, challenges, and broader perspectives that need to be addressed to jointly consider blockchain and ML for communications and networking systems."

The affordability of video editing tools and social networks has facilitated the creation and spread of videos carrying disinformation, i.e. fake videos. Previous attempts to categorize disinformation have focused on content analysis and ascertaining the intention of creators. To extend these approaches, it is beneficial to incorporate the perspective of other fields that study the trustworthiness of records, such as archival science, to help detect and categorize fake videos. This paper proposes to leverage archival science in combination with computer engineering to devise a new framework for detecting and categorizing fake videos. In doing so, the paper offers a case study of the way in which Computational Archival Science, which blends archival and computational thinking, can be used to contribute to a novel approach towards solving the problem of fake videos."

However, this process assumes a trusted centralized infrastructure for coordination, and clients must trust that the central service does not use the byproducts of client data. In addition to this, a group of malicious clients could also harm the performance of the model by carrying out a poisoning attack. As a response, we propose Biscotti: a fully decentralized peer to peer (P2P) approach to multi-party ML, which uses blockchain and cryptographic primitives to coordinate a privacy-preserving ML process between peering clients. Our evaluation demonstrates that Biscotti is scalable, fault tolerant, and defends against known attacks. For example, Biscotti is able to protect the privacy of an individual client's update and the performance of the global model at scale when 30% of adversaries are trying to poison the model.

In this framework, how to reach a consensus between the nodes while simultaneously guaranteeing the performance of both MEC and blockchain systems is a major challenge. Meanwhile, resource allocation, block size, and the number of consecutive blocks produced by each producer are critical to the performance of B-MEC. Therefore, an adaptive resource allocation and block generation scheme is proposed. To improve the throughput of the overlaid blockchain system and the quality of services (QoS) of the users in the underlaid MEC system, spectrum allocation, size of the blocks, and number of producing blocks for each producer are formulated as a joint optimization problem, where the time-varying wireless links and computation capacity of the MEC servers are considered. Since this problem is intractable using traditional methods, we resort to the deep reinforcement learning approach. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing with other baseline methods."
"Erlay: Efficient Transaction Relay for Bitcoin","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/research/research-papers/erlay-efficient-transaction-relay-bitcoin","Ivan Beschastnikh, Gregory Maxwell , Pieter Wuille , Gleb Naumenko","2019-11-13T00:00:00Z","Bitcoin is a top-ranked cryptocurrency that has experienced huge growth and survived numerous attacks. The protocols making up Bitcoin must therefore accommodate the growth of the network and ensure security. Security of the Bitcoin network depends on connectivity between the nodes. Higher connectivity yields better security. In this paper we make two observations: (1) current connectivity in the Bitcoin network is too low for optimal security; (2) at the same time, increasing connectivity will substantially increase the bandwidth used by the transaction dissemination protocol, making it prohibitively expensive to operate a Bitcoin node. Half of the total bandwidth needed to operate a Bitcoin node is currently used to just announce transactions. Unlike block relay, transaction dissemination has received little attention in prior work. We propose a new transaction dissemination protocol, Erlay, that not only reduces the bandwidth consumption by 40% assuming current connectivity, but also keeps the bandwidth use almost constant as the connectivity increases. In contrast, the existing protocol increases the bandwidth consumption linearly with the number of connections. By allowing more connections at a small cost, Erlay improves the security of the Bitcoin network. And, as we demonstrate, Erlay also hardens the network against attacks that attempt to learn the origin node of a transaction. Erlay is currently being investigated by the Bitcoin community for future use with the Bitcoin protocol."

"A Secure Consensus Protocol for Sidechains","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/research/research-papers/secure-consensus-protocol-sidechains","Chen Feng, Cesar Grajales, Jianyu Niu, Mohammad Jalalzai","2019-06-15T00:00:00Z","Sidechain technology has been envisioned as a promising solution to accelerate today's public blockchains in terms of scalability and interoperability. By relying on the mainchain for security, different sidechains can formulate their own rules to reach consensus. Although the literature has considered the possibility of using consensus protocols in the sidechain, so far a tailor-made consensus protocol for sidechains with high performance and formal security proof has not been attempted. To fill this gap, we introduce Cumulus, a low overhead, highly efficient, security provable sidechain protocol. Cumulus makes use of smart contracts to ensure that only one block proposed in the sidechain will be enforced on the mainchain in each round, thereby achieving consensus in an efficient manner. We give a formal specification of Cumulus which ensures safety and liveness without any online requirements of clients. For security analysis, we provide formal security definitions and proofs under Universally Composable Security (UCS) model. As a proof of concept, we implement Cumulus and evaluate it in an Ethereum testnet."
"Selfish Mining in Ethereum","https://blockchain.ubc.ca/research/research-papers/selfish-mining-ethereum","Chen Feng, Jianyu Niu","2019-04-19T00:00:00Z","As the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and today's biggest decentralized platform that runs smart contracts, Ethereum has received much attention from both industry and academia. Nevertheless, there exist very few studies about the security of its mining strategies, especially from the selfish mining perspective. In this paper, we aim to fill this research gap by analyzing selfish mining in Ethereum and understanding its potential threat. First, we introduce a 2-dimensional Markov process to model the behavior of a selfish mining strategy inspired by a Bitcoin mining strategy proposed by Eyal and Sirer. Second, we derive the stationary distribution of our Markov model and compute long-term average mining rewards. This allows us to determine the threshold of computational power that makes selfish mining profitable in Ethereum. We find that this threshold is lower than that in Bitcoin mining (which is 25% as discovered by Eyal and Sirer), suggesting that Ethereum is more vulnerable to selfish mining than Bitcoin."

On these blockchain-based platforms, video transcoding, which is computational intensive and time consuming, is still a major challenge. Meanwhile, the block size of the underlying blockchain has significant impacts on the system performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel blockchain-based framework with adaptive block size for video streaming with mobile edge computing (MEC). First, we design an incentive mechanism to facilitate the collaborations among content creators, video transcoders and consumers. In addition, we present a block size adaptation scheme for blockchain-based video streaming. Moreover, we consider two offloading modes, i.e., offloading to the nearby MEC nodes or a group of device-to-device (D2D) users, to avoid the overload of MEC nodes. Then, we formulate the issues of resource allocation, scheduling of offloading, and adaptive block size as an optimization problem. We employ a low-complexity alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm to solve the problem in a distributed fashion. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."

However, the volume of hard and soft laws has created complexity and fragmentation for consumers and firms. In addition, global value chains are increasingly disaggregated, making it difficult for consumers to enforce breaches of sustainability representations. Blockchain, as an immutable and digital record keeping system, is a tool that can deal with this growing complexity in global value chains. Documents verifying sustainability that were once in the private domain and stored in paper copy can now be made accessible in a secure and transparent blockchain platform. Despite a growing interest in the potential of blockchain to transform businesses, there are few concrete examples or scholarly literature showing how blockchain is operationalized in practice. Using a “conceptual framework analysis” approach, we develop an Evidence, Verifiability, and Enforceability (EVE) framework to illustrate how blockchain can enhance sustainability by providing information to consumers on the origin of products, assurances as to the veracity of the information, and a mechanism to enforce representations through the blockchain smart contract function. However, there need to be safeguards put in place for blockchain technology to meet its promise and we discuss some of these challenges."

First, we find that most ICOs receive a low rating. In fact, over half of the ICOs actually do not need a blockchain. Second, ICO projects with a higher rating raised more funds over the ICO period, after controlling for whether the issuers also disclose information on their business plans, founding teams, token distributions, use of proceeds, etc. Furthermore, highly-rated ICOs are more likely to exceed the minimum funding target. These results are consistent with ICO token buyers/investors taking into consideration the underlying blockchain technology of the ICO projects when making their purchasing/investing decisions. Since the white paper is the main source of ICO information, our findings imply that the credibility of this information is important to protect the interests of ICO buyers/investors and to ensure the long-term viability of ICO as a capital-raising tool for blockchain-based ventures."

The attacker in our strategy observes the length of the honest branch when a submitted transaction becomes available in the blockchain, and then updates the attack strategy accordingly. This provides a stronger strategy than conventional double-spending attack. We then derive closed-form expressions for the probability of a successful attack and the expected reward of attacker miners. Our analysis shows that the probability of a successful attack by convincing the network nodes to follow the counterfeit branch under the proposed attack strategy is 60% higher than what is expected from the conventional attack strategy when the attackers acquire 40% of the total network processing power. To counter this increase in the probability of attack, the network nodes are required to use a bigger number of confirmation blocks for validating any transaction in the blockchain. We computed the expected reward of an attacker for mining a counterfeit branch on a blockchain and observed that the expected reward drops to zero after a few number of block confirmations.

Multi-dimensional reconciliation using multi-edge low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with low code rates and long block lengths has been shown to improve error-correction performance and extend the maximum reconciliation distance. We introduce a quasi-cyclic code construction for multi-edge codes that is highly suitable for hardware-accelerated decoding on a graphics processing unit (GPU). When combined with an 8-dimensional reconciliation scheme, our LDPC decoder achieves an information throughput of 7.16 Kbit/s on a single NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPU, at a maximum distance of 142 km with a secret key rate of 6.64 × 10−8bits/pulse for a rate 0.02 code with block length of 106bits. The LDPC codes presented in this work can be used to extend the previous maximum CV-QKD distance of 100 km to 142 km, while delivering up to 3.50× higher information throughput over the tight upper bound on secret key rate for a lossy channel.

For instance, resource sharing in the D2D network features ubiquitous availability, flexibility, low latency and low cost. However, these features also bring along challenges when building a satisfactory resource sharing system in the D2D network. Specifically, user mobility is one of the top concerns for designing a cooperative D2D computational resource sharing system since mutual communication may not be stably available due to user mobility. A previous endeavour has demonstrated and proven how connectivity can be incorporated into cooperative task scheduling among users in the D2D network to effectively lower average task execution time. There are doubts about whether this type of task scheduling scheme, though effective, presents fairness among users. In other words, it can be unfair for users who contribute many computational resources while receiving little when in need. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based credit system that can be incorporated into the connectivity-aware task scheduling scheme to enforce fairness among users in the D2D network. Users’ computational task cooperation will be recorded on the public blockchain ledger in the system as transactions, and each user’s credit balance can be easily accessible from the ledger. A supernode at the base station is responsible for scheduling cooperative computational tasks based on user mobility and user credit balance. We investigated the performance of the credit system, and simulation results showed that with a minor sacrifice of average task execution time, the level of fairness can obtain a major enhancement."
