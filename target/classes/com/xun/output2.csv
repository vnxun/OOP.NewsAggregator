Many people began to leave  fearing that Israel was moving ahead with its long-planned invasion of Rafah  despite stiff international pressure. The Israeli military began dropping leaflets in eastern Rafah telling people to move to what it called a humanitarian zone to the north  and said it would also notify people by text messages  phone calls and broadcasts in Arabic  and on Monday night  the Israeli military carried out another round of what it called “targeted strikes” in Rafah against Hamas.

A military spokesman would not say when troops might enter the crowded city  but described the evacuation as part of Israel’s plans to dismantle Hamas and to free hostages taken on Oct. 7. Hours after the evacuation order  the political leader of Hamas  Ismail Haniyeh  issued a statement that the group had accepted a new cease-fire proposal from Qatar and Egypt  which have acted as intermediaries in peace talks. The group and Israeli officials said it was not referring to the proposal that Israel recently agreed to  leaving the conflict unresolved.

But even as the security situation worsens and millions of Haitians go hungry  a military-style deployment that is estimated to cost $600 million has just a fraction of the funding required. Biden administration officials would not say whether a precise date for the deployment date had been set. The Kenyan government did not respond to requests for comment. Several military flights  including at least seven from Charleston Air Force Base in South Carolina  have landed at Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince  the capital  in the past week  according to the U.S. Southern Command. Contractors were being flown in to help secure the airport before building a base of operations there for the international security force. More planes carrying construction contractors and equipment were expected in the coming days. “The deployment of the multinational security support mission in Haiti is urgent  and we’re doing all we can to advance that goal ” Brian A. Nichols  assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs  told reporters last week. “Every day that goes by is a lost opportunity to provide greater security for the Haitian people.

Gangs have shut down the airport; looted seaports  public buildings and shops; and attacked nearly a dozen police stations. Roads are blocked  cutting off the food supply  and 4 600 inmates were freed after prisons were attacked. The prime minister  Ariel Henry  is stranded in Puerto Rico while gang members wreak havoc  demand his resignation and hold up dozens of trucks filled with World Food Program food shipments. A state of emergency around Port-au-Prince  the capital  was extended another month. With the government on the verge of collapse  the United States and Caribbean nations are working to come up with a resolution — including a plan for a transitional government — that would restore some semblance of order to the troubled nation and allow Mr. Henry to return home. Who are the gangs and what do they want? Experts estimate that up to 200 gangs operate in Haiti  about 20 of them in Port-au-Prince. They range from small groups of a few dozen young men who share pistols to crews of roughly 1 500 men with weekly salaries and automatic weapons who belong to hierarchal organizations with bosses. Two main gang federations  G-Pèp and the G-9 Family  control many of the poorest neighborhoods in the capital. The criminal groups and their allies sometimes collude  but more often clash.

A heat wave has scorched Mexico in recent days  bringing temperatures in multiple states into the triple digits. Mexico City on Tuesday reached a high of 92 degrees Fahrenheit  the hottest temperature recorded there on May 7 in over 20 years. Mexico’s energy authority  Cenace  announced a state of emergency for the national grid early Tuesday evening  meaning that available power had dropped below adequate levels. It said less than an hour later that the system had returned to normal. But local news media outlets reported on blackouts in municipalities across the country throughout the evening. Social media users uploaded photos and videos of darkened city skylines. Local officials confirmed several blackouts in the state of Mexico  including in San Mateo Atenco and Metepec  near Mexico City. And during a blackout in the city of Nuevo Laredo  near the Texas border  they asked people to avoid driving. In a statement  the national energy agency attributed the electricity shortage on Tuesday afternoon to a series of factors  including a drop in wind and solar power generation. Some power plants were also offline at the time  it said. The statement did not mention the heat wave. An increase in nighttime demand later required rolling power interruptions across Mexico  the agency said. Electricity was gradually being restored starting at about 8 p.m.  in a process that was expected to last until 11 p.m. Mexico has experienced blackouts before  including during extreme weather events  such as hurricanes or heat waves. During power failures in the country last June  local officials reported hundreds of heat-related deaths even as federal and state governments underplayed them.","World","Not related to Blockchain"

Powerful new technologies present a more urgent risk.","There are two distinct factions of parents on TikTok: those who will crack eggs over their kids’ heads for likes and those who are trying desperately to make sure the internet doesn’t know who their children are. Listen to This Article For the 35-year-old TikTok star who posts under the name Kodye Elyse  an uncomfortable online experience made her stop including her three children on her social media. A video she posted in 2020 of her young daughter dancing attracted millions of views and creepy comments from strange men. (She requested that The New York Times not print her full name because she and her children have been doxxed in the past.) “It’s kind of like ‘The Truman Show’ on the internet ” said Kodye Elyse  who has four million followers on TikTok and posts about her work as a cosmetic tattoo artist and her experiences as a single mother. “You never know who’s looking.” After that experience  she scrubbed her children’s images from the internet. She tracked down all of her online accounts  on sites such as Facebook and Pinterest  and deleted them or made them private. She has since joined the clamorous camp of TikTokers encouraging fellow parents not to post about their children publicly. But in September  she discovered her efforts hadn’t been entirely successful. Kodye Elyse used PimEyes  a startling search engine that finds photos of a person on the internet within seconds using facial recognition technology. When she uploaded a photo of her 7-year-old son  the results included an image of him she had never seen before. She needed a $29.99 subscription to see where the image had come from.

The speculation has arisen because the fund  the $59 billion Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust — more commonly known as BREIT — has managed to keep an “appraised” value of its assets that far exceeds virtually every other real estate fund. Many rivals have fallen in value  some quite dramatically  in the face of high interest rates and a flagging property market. BREIT’s performance has floated above its competition  and it has boasted a 10.5 percent annual return since its 2017 debut. The debate over the fund’s impressive performance has taken on greater significance  and the criticism has grown louder  because of how Blackstone determines the appraised value of its assets  DealBook’s Andrew Ross Sorkin and Michael de la Merced report. Many major firms rely on a third-party appraiser to determine the worth of a fund’s assets  in part so investors can trust that the appraised value is accurate and not unduly influenced by the firms. (Those appraisals help to determine a firm’s management fees: The higher the appraisal value  the higher the fees.) Blackstone appears to do it differently. While it uses a third-party appraiser and an outside auditor  the firm has the final say on the appraised value of its own assets. Blackstone is open about its approach. From a recent prospectus: “These assumptions are determined by the Adviser  and reviewed by our independent valuation advisor.” While Blackstone discloses how it determines the final valuation  some on Wall Street have questioned how much latitude firms should have in appraising their own assets.

A spokesman for Alvin L. Bragg  the Manhattan district attorney  said prosecutors planned to drop their case against Mr. Cenat and two other men  Denzel Dennis and Muktar Din  in exchange for the apology and $57 000 in restitution. Mr. Cenat paid $55 000 of the restitution total  which went to the Union Square Partnership to cover landscaping and other costs  the district attorney’s office said. Mr. Dennis and Mr. Din paid the balance. Mr. Cenat posted the apology on his Snapchat account on Tuesday  and Mr. Bragg’s spokeswoman  M’Niyah Lynn  said the prosecution would be dropped once the apology had been online for 24 hours. Mr. Dennis and Mr. Din were expected to post the apology as well. Mr. Cenat  noting that he is from New York  wrote in the apology that what began as a promotional event had quickly turned into “an unsafe situation for the people who live and work in the neighborhood  first responders and my followers that attended the event.” “It was never my intent for it to get so out of hand ” he added  “and I have learned a very valuable lesson that social media is a very powerful tool to do good  but it can also cause dangerous  unwanted situations if it is not used properly.” The Union Square episode  which began shortly after 3 p.m. on Aug. 4 and lasted several hours  resulted in 65 arrests (nearly half of them of underage youths); injuries to police officers and some of those in the crowd; and damage to food carts  police vehicles and stores  officials said. The events began when Mr. Cenat  who has millions of followers on Twitch and other social media platforms  summoned his fans to the area  where he said he would give away video game consoles. The gathering lacked a city permit  and the police learned of it from a social media post only hours before the crowd began swelling  officials said at the time. Hordes of young people were soon packing Union Square Park and spilling onto the surrounding streets and sidewalks and blocking cars and pedestrians. The Union Square Greenmarket shut down early  and subway trains began bypassing the Union Square station. Within an hour  the Police Department had initiated a Level 4 mobilization  its highest-level response. Some in the crowd were peaceful  but others were not. One cluster of people stormed a construction site. Building materials  rocks  bottles  basketballs  a computer and fireworks sailed through the crowd. “I believe he saw that day how much influence he really has ” Jeffrey Maddrey  the Police Department’s chief of department  said of Mr. Cenat afterward.","New York","Not related to Blockchain"

Trump’s trial said he would consider jailing the former president should he continue to violate court orders  Mayor Eric Adams said the city’s lockups stand ready. “Our amazing commissioner  she is prepared for whatever comes on Rikers Island ” said the mayor at an unrelated news conference  apparently referring to Lynelle Maginley-Liddie  the commissioner of the Department of Correction. “I’m pretty sure she would be prepared to manage and deal with the situation.” Justice Juan M. Merchan  the judge presiding over Mr. Trump’s criminal trial in Lower Manhattan  on Monday warned the former president that should he continue to defy a gag order  he might end up on Rikers  because fines “are not serving as a deterrent.” “Going forward  this court will have to consider jail ” Justice Merchan said. The judge has prohibited the former president from making attacks on witnesses  jurors and court staff  an order Mr. Trump has repeatedly violated. The prospect of Mr. Trump ending up on Rikers Island  New York City’s main jail and a notoriously violent  dilapidated facility  has already been the topic of discussion among federal  state and local officials.

If Mr. Trump does end up on Rikers Island  he would be in prominent company. His longtime financial lieutenant  Allen H. Weisselberg  is serving a five-month sentence on Rikers for perjury.

Trump met Stormy Daniels  their flirtation seemed fleeting: He was a 60-year-old married mogul at the peak of reality television fame  and she was 27  a Louisiana native raised in poverty and headed to porn-film stardom. But that chance encounter in Lake Tahoe  Nev.  some two decades ago is now at the center of the first criminal trial of an American president  an unprecedented case that could shape the 2024 presidential race.

Trump and the ensuing hush-money cover-up that has become the bedrock of the prosecution’s case. Ms. Daniels spoke quickly and at length about her first meeting with Mr. Trump at a celebrity golf tournament near Lake Tahoe in Nevada. After the lunch break  Mr. Trump’s lawyer Todd Blanche moved for a mistrial  arguing that the prosecution’s questions had been designed to embarrass Mr. Trump and prejudice the jury. The judge  Juan M. Merchan  agreed that some of Ms. Daniels’s testimony might have “been better left unsaid ” but he denied a mistrial. The former president is accused of falsifying business records to cover up a $130 000 payment to Ms. Daniels just before the 2016 election. Mr. Trump  77  has denied the charges and says he did not have sex with Ms. Daniels. If convicted  he could face prison time or probation. Here are six takeaways from Mr. Trump’s 13th day on trial. Prosecutors took a risk with their witness. Jurors heard a vivid account of the Lake Tahoe encounter and met the woman who received the hush-money deal. This could present a risk for prosecutors  depending on whether the jury viewed Ms. Daniels’s story as prurient or powerful.

That inquiry reflects the evolving calculations of Mr. Trump’s vice-presidential search — and how his scramble to keep up with President Biden’s colossal fund-raising totals may be weighing on his mind as he considers his options. Mr. Trump’s selection process  which is still in its early stages  has largely revolved around conventional questions like who could step in as president if needed  political calculations including contenders’ position on abortion rights  and more Trumpian curiosities like whether a politician physically resembles his idea of a vice president. But Mr. Trump has asked several people about the fund-raising prowess of possible running mates  according to three people with direct knowledge of the conversations  signaling a fresh angle in his search for a running mate.
